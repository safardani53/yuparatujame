Our testers put a wide range of portable fire pits to the test. Among our winners are propane fire pits, fire pits ideal for grilling and camping, and wood-burning fire pits perfect for backyard gatherings.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">So keep scrolling to discover the best portable fire pits, vetted by PEOPLE Tested.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-inno-stage-portable-smokeless-fire-pit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Inno Stage Smokeless Fire Pit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Inno Stage Portable Smokeless Fire Pit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/ZiyNhTO2_aijQTUuWZTsRfdYocY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/inno-stage-smokeless-portable-fire-pit-c87f601fd473495b98ca369c440fd91c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our overall winner for portable fire pits was very easy to get set up — the only assembly required is stacking the larger piece on top of the smaller one, and filling the fire pit with wood pellets.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“I really like the simplicity of this fire pit,” says our tester. “The modern design looks more expensive than it is, and because it's only two pieces, it's super easy to set up and pack away.” When packed inside its carrying case, this fire pit is super compact for both moving around as well as storing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Getting the fire going with wood pellets was a bit troublesome for our tester, who used a fire starter to start things up. But once they were lit, the fire was clean and controlled, with no smoke, ash, or sparks. “The only thing I don't like is that I have to purchase wood pellets for it, but that's what gives it such a clean, smokeless burn, so I suppose it's worth it,” our tester adds. “Some of the reviewers mentioned that they went ahead and burned logs in this pit with no issues, so I may try that eventually.”&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">At around $70-$95 depending on the time of year, this fire pit is well worth the price, especially for its simple design and portability. Our tester gave it a perfect score across all our testing categories: assembly, portability, heating performance, design, and value.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>7 x 15 x 12.5 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 16 lbs. | <strong>Material:</strong> Metal | <strong>Finish type: </strong>Painted | <strong>Shape: </strong>Round&nbsp;| <strong>Fuel type:</strong> Wood | <strong>Assembly required:</strong> No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-runner-up-best-overall-solo-stove-ranger-20></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Runner-Up, Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Solo Stove Ranger 2.0</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Solo Stove Ranger 2.0" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/K3oZjYw71Q-SwO1z-Rh9JPPnH3E=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/solo-stove-ranger-20-e798dbb4d4b04365a948a61c2408fa57.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=2><li readability=1><p>Simple, stylish, two-piece design</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Just add more wood to keep fire going</p></li><li readability=1><p>Easy to use, empty, and transport</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=0><p>Expensive, particularly at full price</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Not truly smokeless in our testing</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With just two pieces — a “can” and a “ring” — this is a very easy fire pit to set up, use, and store. “Keeping flames going was as easy as just adding more wood,” says our tester. And while it's advertised as smokeless, our tester claims it's really more of a low-smoke option.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With its simple design and small size, the Ranger 2.0 still produced a decent fire. “It would be great for a tailgate or camping,” she adds, noting its basic design and how easy it was to move around and empty. The Ranger is a great choice for travel, as the two-piece design means there aren’t small parts to lose in transit or put back together. “It feels very solid and worth the extra money," she says. Plus, even though it's metal, she said it the exterior doesn't get super hot.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We also appreciate the simple design for dumping out the ashes. Besides using the Ranger for camping and tailgating, it can be used at home for a quick and easy fire to sit around or to make s’mores. With just a few logs, our tester was able to have a fire for over an hour in her backyard.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 15 x 12.5 inches | <strong>Weight: </strong>15 lbs. | <strong>Material: </strong>Stainless steel | <strong>Shape: </strong>Round&nbsp;| <strong>Fuel type: </strong>Wood | <strong>Assembly required: </strong>No<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Riddley Gemperlein-Schirm</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-uco-flatpack-portable-stainless-steel-grill-and-fire-pit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>UCO Flatpack Portable Stainless Steel Grill and Fire Pit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=uco-flatpack-portable-stainless-steel-grill-and-fire-pit style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/YSvmL4kr-FZduvsg-rSMlyz1hBU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/uco-flatpack-portable-stainless-steel-grill-and-fire-pit-669eb6adfdaf4089a0c0d88a6eb57147.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Extremely easy to set up and move around</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Includes a storage bag for portability</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Basic design easily fits in car trunk</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You’ll be up and running in no time with this portable grill and fire pit.

It’s ideal for those who camp often and want to take up the least storage space possible among their gear — everything fits nicely inside the storage bag when you’re done using it.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We gave this model a perfect overall score of 5/5 after testing it at a picnic, making burgers using standard charcoal briquettes. “The added value or extreme portability makes it outperform others — it’s hard to put a price on fitting well in your car trunk," our tester says. "You know the value when you see it.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>7.5 x 16 x 7.48 inches&nbsp;| <strong>Weight:</strong> 3.3 lbs. | <strong>Material: </strong>Stainless steel | <strong>Finish type:</strong> Brushed | <strong>Fuel type:</strong> Charcoal | <strong>Assembly required: </strong>No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-with-grill-attachment-snow-peak-takibi-fire-and-grill></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best with Grill Attachment</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Snow Peak Takibi Fire and Grill</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Snow Peak Takibi Fire and Grill" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/JIONC7wXgvRLH8MJghvahtiweCs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Snow-Peak-Takibi-Fire-and-Grill-71ee8ee248e444ab9a3be87aa248003b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Back Country</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Produces the perfect heating performance</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Smart design folds down entirely into a carrying case</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Base plate catches falling ash</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It was a super-easy and straightforward setup on this hybrid fire pit and grill. “We really loved the heating performance of this fire pit,” says our tester. “The fire was easy to build and sustain and it seemed to put off just the right amount of heat for grilling food or sitting around it.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We were most impressed by the smart design, which folds down entirely into a carrying case. It also comes with a base plate to put underneath it to catch any falling ash or embers. The grill rests easily on top of the fire pit and can be adjusted to three different heights depending on the heat of your fire and how quickly or slowly you'd like to cook your food.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“At first I thought $350 was a bit much for a portable fire pit and grill, but after testing the Breeo Y, which is $100 more, I think this one is a good value,” our tester says. “It's a lot more adaptable and can be used in multiple settings and has such a good burn." And the more our tester used it, the more they liked it. "It's very easy to transport around, looks good, and is good for actually cooking food," they add.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This is an excellent option for anyone looking for a hybrid fire pit and grill that is easy to use at home, at a park, on the road, or camping.

The fire heated up quickly to make s’mores and melted the chocolate and marshmallows evenly without any issue.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">And while it did take about 20 minutes to assemble (a screwdriver was needed), it wasn't particularly difficult — but because of this, this may not be the best choice for anyone who is expecting to use a fire pit right out of the box. Ultimately, it's a great value. “This fire pit is definitely worth the price," says our tester, emphasizing its quick heat-up time and great price point.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>22 x 22 x 20 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 12.27 lbs.&nbsp;| <strong>Material: </strong>Alloy steel | <strong>Shape: </strong>Round&nbsp;| <strong>Fuel type: </strong>Wood | <strong>Assembly required: </strong>Yes<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-propane-bond-manufacturing-aurora-portable-steel-propane-gas-fire-pit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Propane</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Bond Manufacturing Aurora Portable Steel Propane Gas Fire Pit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Bond Manufacturing Aurora Portable Steel Propane Gas Fire Pit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/rKyNlLnE68YK0pMachfGoIqt-Ks=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Bond-Manufacturing-Aurora-Portable-Steel-Propane-Gas-Fire-Pit-587625163b6a4b91850f141073e2da2c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list"><li><p>Easy to start up<br></p></li><li><p>Lid locks for safety</p></li><li><p>Produces excellent heat</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We loved the design of this fire pit, which is both aesthetically pleasing and highly functional. The lid locks in place, so if the pit should tip over, you’re less likely to have an accident.&nbsp;It’s very easy to start a fire with this model — you simply hook it up to a propane tank and turn the knob. It puts out a lot of heat while remaining portable. “I would definitely recommend this fire pit, especially if you have a small outdoor area, or if you go camping," says our tester.

However, it did take awhile to get the fire to their desired temperature.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Assembly was fairly easy, and our tester liked the sleek design. However, the bottom of the fire pit wasn’t heavy enough to endure light wind — it moved during our testing with just some light breeze. We found it to be well worth the price point, despite the disappointing weight on the bottom. Recommended for backyard get-togethers, beach trips, camping, and tailgates — ultimately, this fire pit is ideal for anyone who would like a fire pit for on-the-go.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>10 x 10 x 4.5 inches | <strong>Weight: </strong>5.94 lbs. | <strong>Material: </strong>Steel frame | <strong>Finish type:</strong> Matte | <strong>Shape: </strong>Round | <strong>Includes: </strong>Lava rocks | <strong>Fuel type:</strong> Propane | <strong>Assembly required:</strong> Yes | <strong>Maximum heat output:</strong> 10,000 BTU<strong><br></strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-things-to-consider-when-buying-a-portable-fire-pit></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Things to Consider When Buying a Portable Fire Pit</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Heat Source</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Propane fire pits have unique advantages over wood burning pits: they offer consistent heat output and controlled flame size, plus they rarely spit out hot embers,” says SunVilla marketing manager Maggie Gala. “Often, a propane pit can be used in instances where a wood burning fire is not allowed.

However, Gala also suggests waiting until the fall if you want to score a great deal. The downsides of fall buying is that there will be less inventory and styles to choose from as many will be sold out after the summer season.<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Jennifer May</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-we-tested></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How We Tested</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our testers unboxed and assembled 26 fire pits, noting the time it took to assemble. Testers picked up the assembled fire pit and walked around with it for five minutes to evaluate its portability. Then a fire was started in each pit, with testers paying attention to how much smoke and heat are produced, plus how well the fire pit cooks if it’s a grill-fire pit combo. Then each fire pit was cleaned and packed up. Testers rated the fire pits on assembly, portability, heating performance, design, and after all other testing was completed, value for the price. Special attention was also paid to features like smokeless or collapsible fire pits.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-f83b7a3d-2471-4ad5-bc9d-689679775b92></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=48.415279878971><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.86697247706422><p><span class=accordion__title>What is the best portable fire pit?</span></p><p>The <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">INNO STAGE Smokeless Fire Pit</a> earned an average 5/5 rating from our tests, making it our best overall pick.

While paved surfaces are ideal, you can place a fire pit on a wooden or composite deck or grassy area if fireproofing and other precautions are followed.”</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-trust-people></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Trust PEOPLE?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Rennie Dyball</a> is a commerce writer.
