Dead at the age of 16.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/f86ee912-49c3-4b63-a030-707a9eef6a8a.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/police-hi-visibility-jackets-policing-867564249.jpg><p>Back at <a href=#>Harry</a>’s home his mum had prepared his dinner. He never got to eat it. <a href=#>His sister Tayla</a> revealed his mother “can’t bring herself to remove it” from the oven.</p><p>Harry was reportedly a good kid and not involved in any gang-related stuff.</p><p>It is a horrible, heartbreaking story. And yet also terribly familiar.</p><p>Last year 21 <a href=#>teenagers</a> met violent deaths in <a href=#>London</a>. That’s up by 50 per cent on the previous year.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON ROD LIDDLE ">READ MORE ON ROD LIDDLE</h2><p>Everybody has said how tragic Harry’s story is. Including the odious Mayor of London, <a href=#>Sadiq Khan</a>.</p><p>But nobody seems to want to address WHY it is that so many kids have become feral creatures, wedded to a life of violence.</p><p>The Met <a href=#>Police</a> said they thought the killing wasn’t racially motivated. But whatever. We’re all agreed how awful it is.</p><p>What the politicians wringing their hands also NEVER say, however, is how this epidemic of violence can be halted.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>For years they have talked tough and done <span id=868bed31-9634-4ff3-b17d-acb9823af89b class=suggested-link>next</span> to nothing. We’ve had <a href=#>David Cameron</a> on being locked up for possessing a knife, crackdowns on social media, bans on <a href=#>selling zombie knives online</a> — but nothing happens.</p><p>There were 13,503 <a href=#>knife crimes in London</a> between July 2022 and June 2023, up 21 per cent on the previous year. And more than 1,000 gun crimes.</p><p>Most of these crimes are committed by young men. And a large majority of homicide victims (62 per cent) and offenders (65 per cent) are Black Londoners. That’s from Sadiq Khan’s own figures, by the way.</p><p>And that is one reason why the <a href=#>politicians </a>stay well away from the issue.</p><p>Harry Pitman’s granddad, beside himself with grief, suggested that anyone found with a knife in public should maybe serve an automatic two-year sentence.</p><p>But you’d be locking up an awful lot of youngsters from ethnic minorities. Which politician would go along with that?</p><p>The truth is that leftie hypocrisy and a wish by the police not to be seen as racist has hugely contributed to our capital city becoming so violent.</p><p>The Left — and the <a href=#>race</a> charities — will scream blue murder if a disproportionate number of non-white youths are searched or arrested.</p><p>They conveniently forget a dispro-portionate number of violent crimes are committed by non-white youths.</p><p>The Left always objects to such policies as stop and search. They say it is racist.</p><p>And it seems there is no <a href=#>crime</a> worse than being racist, not even murder.</p><p>Suggest for a moment that perhaps an absence of fathers in the <span id=174817f2-3478-4217-a139-3961f70d10dd class=suggested-link>homes</span> from which these kids come might have something to do with it and the Left will howl that you are “demonising” single mums AND being racist.</p><p>Suggest <a href=#>schools</a>, which indulge kids by championing music that glorifies a violent gang culture, may have something to do with it and the liberals will shout you down.</p><p>For the left it is simply a matter of fact that non-white youths are being discriminated against, econom-ically and socially.</p><p>I have said before that political correct-ness isn’t simply irritating, but that it can kill people.</p><p>Harry Pitman happ-ened to be white, but the overwhelming maj-ority of youth homi-cides are young black kids. The only thing stopping us from addressing this issue is political cant and a fear of being called racist.</p><p>How long will we allow politeness to prevent us from taking action?</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">SHOW SPINE, SUNAK</h2><p>DOCTORS are very quickly becoming an even more disliked bunch of grifters than estate agents and used car salesmen.</p><p>Not only do they make it nigh on impossible to see them, the young doctors are also determined to bring down our Government.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/female-gp-portrait-869583600.jpg><p>There is not the slightest doubt that the quacks’ latest strike is politically motivated.</p><p>They have the effrontery to demand a 35-per-cent pay rise.</p><p>Yes, we have a low-wage economy and that is a real problem. But the doctors are hardly a part of that.</p><p>The worry is that the Government will cave in because the <a href=#>General Election</a> is approaching.</p><p>Show some spine, Rishi.</p><p>I WENT out with a bunch of mates for a meal on New Year’s Eve.</p><p>The waitress was very pretty and personable. On one momentous occasion she actually called me “darling”.</p><p>This cheered me up a lot. I said to my friends: “Darling, huh? I wonder what she means by that!”</p><p>One of them leaned across the table and replied: “It means you’re old.”</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">SHOVE ’ORF</h2><p>THE appalling <a href=#>Munroe Bergdorf </a>has been chosen to represent British women, by the <a href=#>United Nations</a> agency UN Women UK.</p><p>If Bergdorf really does represent British women it’s time to get the hell out of the country.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/munroe-bergdorf-ref-spl10401639-864232339-1.jpg><p>Bergdorf has made a series of odious racist comments. Apparently all white folk are racist.</p><p>Bergdorf also made nasty comments about a lesbian. But, more importantly, Bergdorf isn’t even a woman.</p><p>Yup, Munroe is <a href=#>transgender</a> and 17 campaigning women’s groups have complained about the appointment.</p><p>I know that it’s all one might expect from the UN...but when is this idiocy going to stop?</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">God forbid we’re hit by real storm</h2><p>WHO the hell is Henk? As in <a href=#>Storm Henk</a>, that gentle zephyr which lightly caressed the Home Counties a day or so ago?</p><p>Why would you call a storm that? They are getting more and more skittish and stupid with the names they bestow upon <a href=#>weather</a> patterns.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/odin-sleipnir-eight-legged-horse-869586604.jpg><p>Some of which totally <span id=5b736291-c5b8-4519-a098-8b56b4c9f0a2 class=suggested-link>fail</span> to live up to the name “storm”.</p><p>Anyway, in <span id=d1903ea0-1f4a-48cf-abe5-b9797049a175 class=suggested-link>future</span>, storms should sound like storms. We want names like Odin and Rommel.</p><p>Meanwhile, I heard a weathergirl refer to some people as “weather responders”.</p><p>A new chunk of stupid terminology for a stupid new year. What IS a weather responder? Someone who responds to weather?</p><p>Much like I do when I see it’s raining outside and decide not to take the dog for a walk but to watch Bangers And Cash on Yesterday.</p><p>That’s responding to weather, isn’t it?</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">FAIR TO TARGET AROURI</h2><p>THEY say that every man’s death diminishes us. Maybe that’s true.</p><p>But between you and me, I didn’t feel THAT diminished when <a href=#>Saleh al-Arouri </a>was blown to smithereens by an Israeli rocket.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/hamas-deputy-head-politburo-saleh-869454692-1.jpg><p>Arouri was the deputy leader of the <a href=#>Hamas </a><a href=#>terrorists</a>.</p><p>The <a href=#>Israelis </a>located him in Beirut and now the only thing left of the grizzled old thug is his beard.</p><p>Incredibly, the <a href=#>BBC</a> and one or two others are worrying that this might spread the war into <a href=#>Lebanon</a>.</p><p>That will come as <span id=0190877d-1796-4b62-9570-46778e030f08 class=suggested-link>news</span> to the Israelis. They’ve been facing rocket attacks from Hezbollah on a daily basis for years.</p><p>Israel did exactly the right thing.</p><p>INCIDENTALLY, my <a href=#>New Year</a>’s resolution was to try to avoid <a href=#>driving</a> into a tree.</p><p>I did that in 2023 and wasn’t hugely impressed with the outcome. Nor was the tree over-pleased.</p><p>I also made a vow to be less understanding and consensual when cretins are telling me something.</p><p>No more Mr <span id=7ab4b40f-e86e-4774-89a2-f3f3cb52544a class=suggested-link>Nice</span> Guy.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">AULD LANG WHINE</h2><p>I’M an optimistic kind of guy.</p><p>Always prepared to believe that the future will be bright and beautiful.</p><p>So this New Year’s Eve, just like every New Year’s Eve, I sang Auld Lang Syne and told everyone what a brilliant year 2024 was going to be.</p><p>And then I woke up on January 1 with a stinking hangover. I crawled downstairs to find the dog had crapped in the kitchen and that I’d left the freezer lid open and all my food was thawed.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>And a smoke alarm that Sir Chris Bonington would have trouble reaching was chirruping away because it needed new batteries.</p><p>I know a lot of people have to put up with much worse things.
