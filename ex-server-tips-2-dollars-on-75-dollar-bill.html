And then there are those who say that it's gross that folks don't immediately consider a 20% tip for a server when ordering their meals as the majority of their wages essentially depend on the kindness of strangers.</p><p>Inevitably, there are almost always a number of people part of the "pro-tip" crowd who claim that they are servers themselves and say that people have no idea what it's like to work as a waiter or waitress, and if they did, they would never not tip.</p><p>This is probably why this TikToker's post is currently going viral on the popular social media platform.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@jennarion href=#>@jennarion</a><p>@Buffalo Wild Wings your wings are worth it, but the service was so bad ðŸ˜­ <a title=serverproblems href=#>#serverproblems</a> <a title=serverstorytime href=#>#serverstorytime</a> <a title=storytime href=#>#storytime</a> <a title=buffalowildwings href=#>#buffalowildwings</a> <a title=tippingservers href=#>#tippingservers</a> <a title=serverstory href=#>#serverstory</a> <a title=restaurantstorytime href=#>#restaurantstorytime</a> <a title=worstserviceever href=#>#worstserviceever</a></p><a title="â™¬ original sound - Jenna Rion" href=#>â™¬ original sound - Jenna Rion</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @jennarion</span></figure><p>TikTok user Jenna Rion (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@jennarion</a>) explained why she only tipped $2 on a $75 bill during a recent dining experience at a Buffalo Wild Wings location.</p><p>She says in the trending clip: "I have the biggest bone to pick with Buffalo Wild Wings, I have never in my life tipped less than twenty percent but I did tonight and I tipped like $2 on a $75 tab. Let me tell you why."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @jennarion</span></figure><p>She continued, explaining why she left such a relatively small gratuity, "I'm not an a**hole to preface, I'm really not. I worked in food and beverage for like seven years. I've worked at low-end restaurants I've worked at really high-end restaurants, I've worked my a** off and I also know that things are out of your control like how busy it is, like how busy the kitchen is like I understand that things are out of your controls sometimes."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @jennarion</span></figure><p>She says that the situation she encountered was, "beyond that" calling it "the worst service" that she's ever had. As she records the video, she's eating food, and as it turns out, it's from the Buffalo Wild Wings experience she's talking about in the clip. "The reason why I'm eating my chicken at home is cause we literally sat there for probably over two hours."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @jennarion</span></figure><p>She said that when they first arrived to the restaurant everything "started off fine" but they waited about five minutes before a manager approached her table and asked if anyone took their drink orders. The waitress for the table then shows up some ten minutes later with their drinks, but she was missing the lime from the beers and didn't bring any waters like they asked.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @jennarion</span></figure><p>A half hour or so passes and the waitress doesn't come back to the TikToker's table so they had to go to the bar to get their waters and they flagged down another server to get napkins and silverware. The TikToker said that while her fiance had his food delivered to the table, hers wasn't brought out.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @jennarion</span></figure><p>She then said they sat there for about an hour and fifteen minutes longer until the server finally showed up to the table and asked if they wanted more beers. Jenna said that she still hadn't received her food, and the waitress responded apologetically that she would go and check on that for her.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @jennarion</span></figure><p>Her meal then takes another 15-20 minutes to finally arrive, but the fries, which were part of her order, weren't included with it. She then said the server comes back a little while later and "throws" the fries on the table. At this point, they had to go to the host to get to-go boxes, but they were still waiting on their check.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @jennarion</span></figure><p>Other TikTokers said that they were in similar situations, but unlike Jenna, they didn't wait as long and instead stayed seated for about thirty minutes. When the server didn't show up with their bill in that amount of time they just left without paying.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @jennarion</span></figure><p>Others said that they've visited Buffalo Wild Wings in the past and upon being seated waited for 25 minutes without any service. Then there were those who, like Jenna, said that they were extremely polite and patient, but still had a poor experience despite their attempts at being kind and understanding.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @jennarion</span></figure><p>What do you think? What's a reasonable time limit for a server to come in and check on a table? Would you have waited as long as Jenna did?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmsVuv8SrrZ6qXam2sb%2BMa2Sdp5yhrrO%2FjKilZm9lYrGwuMuaqWaamaG5</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./avril-lavigne-hugs-tyga-onstage-world-tour-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Avril Lavigne Hugs Tyga Onstage Amid The End Of Her World Tour: Photos  Hollywood Life">&larr;
