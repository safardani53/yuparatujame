Sedated all the troublemakers lol xxx," the evil senior nurse penned in another message.</p><p>Hudson also bragged that she’d sedated a patient “within an inch of her life”, adding: "Bet she's flat for a week, ha ha."</p><p>In other vile messages, Hudson suggested the sedation of a patient and Wilmot replied: "Ha ha yeah sedation we love it."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>More texts between the pair revealed Hudson claiming she was going to "kill" a patient in bed five and Wilmot responded: "well tonight sedate him to high heaven".</p><p>Hudson replied: "Already in my head to give him double !! Xxx."</p><p>The senior nurse used different drugs, including&nbsp;<a href=#>insomnia&nbsp;</a>medication zopiclone, which can be life-threatening if given inappropriately.</p><p>Prosecutors told the court a "culture of abuse" became evident after pouring through the heartless text messages.</p><p>While patients under Hudson and Wilmot's care were "profoundly unwell", none died and neither defendant has been accused of causing any deaths.</p><p>Hudson was sentenced to seven years and two months at Preston Crown Court today.</p><p>Meanwhile Wilmot was handed a lesser punishment of three years behind bars.</p><p>Hudson’s then partner, who also worked as a senior nurse, Marek Grabianowski, also previously admitted conspiracy to steal drugs and perverting the course of justice.</p><p>He was jailed for 14 months today.</p><p>The court heard how Hudson fed 76-year-old victim Aileen Scott sedatives to keep her "quiet and compliant", after a stoke had left her paralysed.</p><p>Aileen's distraught son Brian dubbed Hudson and Wilmot "pure evil".</p><p>The heartbroken family member said his mother's treatment was "absolutely horrifying, shocking and really disturbing".</p><p>He said: "It's pure evil in my mind. There is a lot of planning that was going on.</p><p>"You could hear that through these messages, the way they were speaking about the patients, they were planning what they were going to do that night to those patients.</p><p>"If my mum had died in that ward, I would have just thought, 'It's really sad that she's died but it's actually due to complications of the stroke,' not actually it could possibly be due to that medication that she had been given, which was not prescribed for her."</p><p>Upon sentencing, the judge said: "You were in a position of trust and responsibility. You offended against vulnerable people in your care over a significant period.</p><p>"There was in each case a risk of harm. We have heard of the risk of sedatives to stroke patients.</p><p>"The relatives of all those patients will always be distressed at the betrayal of trust. There will be a loss of public confidence in the NHS."</p><p>Trish Armstrong-Child, Chief Executive of Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, also issued a statement at Preston Crown Court today.</p><p>She said: "I understand that people are feeling concerned about the evidence heard during this case and want further assurance as to standard of patient care within the Trust.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"We were deeply shocked by these offences and the actions of these individuals in no way reflects our caring and compassionate colleagues, who continue to deliver high quality care across the Trust. The Trust has however taken immediate action to further ensure patient safety within the Trust.</p><p>"Those changes to working practices and culture have been delivered and continue to improve. As Chief Executive, I am committed to a range of actions to ensure the Trust provides the very best care and treatment for all our patients and families, as well as a positive and supportive place for colleagues to be."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ4JxgZNsaW9nnqq%2FtLGMnamun5easW68wK2gnqakqHqnu9FmmKato5q6prrTZqGaoZyasW6%2Fx6iapKGenHq1sdetqmg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./tom-preston-werner.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tom Preston-Werner">&larr;
