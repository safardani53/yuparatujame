I'm quite a physical guy. I love to be active in things. But I'm right-handed, so for two months straight I was just learning everything as left-handed—learning how to write, how to play basketball, everything. I'm such a perfectionist that it wasn't about being good at it—I had to be so good at it.</p><p>The film <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Barry</a>, directed by Vikram Gandhi, was premiered at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival on September 10, 2016.
