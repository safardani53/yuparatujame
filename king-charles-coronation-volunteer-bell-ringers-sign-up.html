We’re standing on the shoulders of hundreds before us who have stood where we stand and rung these bells.”</p><p>With those words ringing in her ears, our Clare begins to feel the pressure.</p><p>She says: “It occurs to me that although I’ve never rung a bell in my life, I’m about to be put in charge of one 253 years old that weighs as much as a small family car.”</p><p>Fellow campanologist Barbara Hocke, who has been ringing at a church in <a href=#>Plymouth</a> for seven years, takes Clare through the drill on a miniature bell purpose-built to show rookies what to do before they are let loose on the real thing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/gives-lesson-clare-oreilly-l-803296227.jpg><p>She says: “The UK is special when it comes to bell ringing. No other country in the world does it like us.</p><p>“Method, or permutational ringing, gives the bell music we’re used to hearing from our churches.</p><p>“Bells across Europe are rung without sequence or method. Kerry shows Clare the ropes, literally, and instructs her to keep her eyes ahead at all times and not to look up.</p><p>Clare says: “I was told scary stories of ropes going rogue and lashing around the tower until they can be brought under control.</p><p>“With Kerry’s experienced hand on my tail end — of the rope — I’m off.<br>“It turns out campanology is more than just a great score in Scrabble. It’s a lot harder than just pulling and letting go.</p><p>“The ‘ring’ comes when the bells are upturned in the tower. And rather than actively pull, it’s about reacting to the natural tension on the rope and letting go of my sally (the fluffy bit on the rope) and catching it again at exactly the right time.”</p><p>Clare, who was joined by fellow ringers Anthony, Olivia Richardson, Anne Russell, Jayne Selby and Christine Harris, says: “Before I know it, I’m in the band and hearing the sound that marks the end of a church service or the end of a wedding.</p><p>“Standing on the stone floor and pulling on a rope in the exact position men or women have stood for centuries is both daunting and warming at the same time. The worn floor reminds me that for two and a half centuries ringers have done exactly what I’m doing.</p><p>“And that’s whether to call villagers to church, celebrate battle victories or mark a funeral or a coronation happening hundreds of miles away in London 70 years ago.”</p><h2>Gentle exercise</h2><p>Carole Carlson and her husband Jon have only been ringing a few weeks after responding to an advert for Ring for The King.</p><p>They describe the social side of <a href=#>bell ringing</a> and the welcome they have received as wonderful.</p><p>Carole says: “There’s tea and coffee midway through practice and then we often all go to the pub down the road afterwards. It’s lovely.</p><p>“Everyone’s so friendly and welcoming.</p><p>“Despite the fact it takes years to learn some of the methods, Kerry’s been a brilliant teacher.’</p><p>With the Ring for The King website receiving more than 1,500 enquiries so far, Kerry and Anthony are delighted whenever anyone new wants to join.</p><p>Kerry says: “We’ve got people of all ages, from young children right the way through. We’ve got families who ring, too.</p><p>“Ring for The King has been wonderful at getting people involved. Not everyone can be in London for the Coronation so being able to take part in it here in our village is a wonderful feeling.</p><p>“Every single person in our band will be ringing to mark the official start of King Charles’s reign.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/features-readiness-kings-coronation-clare-803296185.jpg><p>“We’ve now got our instructions on exactly what to ring on the day — it is a beautiful Coronation peal. Knowing we’re part of a countrywide initiative is wonderful.”</p><p>Vicki Chapman, of the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers, says: “Ringing is a unique way to mark special occasions and coronations, maybe a once-in-a-lifetime event.</p><p>“It is an exciting activity for all ages, especially young people and families. It’s great gentle exercise for mind and body and for developing skills — at an incredibly low cost.</p><p>“Once you’ve mastered it, you’ll wonder why you didn’t start sooner.”</p><p>Eventually, Clare has her clammy palms relieved of bell number five and the experts of St Michael and All Angels demonstrate much more complex peals.</p><p>Clare adds: “Kerry asked me if I’m coming back at the same time next week.</p><p>“With the biscuits just coming out and the pub a short walk away, I’m definitely very tempted to Ring for the King.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Share your thoughts about King Charles</h2><p>FOR 74 years <a href=#>Prince Charles</a> waited to take the throne.</p><p>In that time, as Prince of Wales and now King, he has met countless thousands of people.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/prince-charles-meeting-locals-visit-811350812.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/prince-charles-uniform-meets-locals-811350436.jpg><p>Are you one of them?</p><p>No one ever forgets the day they saw Charles – once the world’s most eligible bachelor whose wife became the most famous woman on Earth before marrying <a href=#>Camilla</a>.</p><p>To mark the <a href=#>Coronation of Charles III</a> we would love YOU to tell us your stories of the day you met the future King.</p><p>You could have been introduced to him, maybe you spotted him on a day out or you got to chat by accident.</p><p>He may have presented you with an award or an honour.</p><p>Maybe you met him on a walkabout, at an official visit or at one of his late mother’s four jubilees.</p><p>Perhaps you have a funny story to tell about the day you <a href=#>met Charles</a>.</p><p>As we approach the historic <a href=#>Coronation</a> we would love to hear your stories and see your pictures of the King & I.</p><p>We have set up a special email address for you to tell us how and when you saw Charles, our new monarch.</p><p>If you have photos of your meeting with the King you can attach them.</p><p>Send your email TODAY to theking@the-sun.co.uk.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Next week we will publish as many of your memories of meeting our new monarch as possible.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Get our brilliant book half-price</h3></p><p>GET a copy of King Charles III: 100 Moments From His Journey To The Throne for half price.</p><p>With a foreword by The Sun’s royal photographer, <a href=#>Arthur Edwards</a>, the book has 100 moments that shaped the man who has become King.</p><p>Thanks to HarperCollins online you can get a copy for £7.50 (RRP £14.99).</p><p>Go to <a href=# aria-label="collins.co.uk/KingCharles (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">collins.co.uk/KingCharles</a> and add the book King Charles III: 100 Moments From His Journey To The Throne to your basket then use exclusive discount code KING50 at the checkout.</p><p><strong>T&Cs:</strong> Offer valid online only until 23.59 on May 9, 2023.
