The Bondi 8 running shoe comes in several fun colors to match your vibe and has breathable mesh throughout the shoe to create airflow. It also has a full EVA foam midsole for arch support and added cushioning, so when you’re running (or walking around town), your foot has padding to cushion each step as it launches off the ground.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The heel-to-toe drop (or difference in cushioning level under your heel compared to under your toes) is about 4 millimeters. This creates a good balance of padding — making this shoe versatile for any athletic pursuits or athleisure days as a cute fitness ‘fit. Just pair these shoes with some cute leggings and you’re good to go.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>9 | <strong>Structure: </strong>Neutral | <strong>Heel-to-Toe Drop: </strong>4 millimeters | <strong>Cushioned: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-nike-revolution-5></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Nike Revolution 5</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nike Revolution 5" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/4D-gYbyLfkuR0JwkLcpIoZY77UA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/NikeRevolution5-3d67afa1b01c45b9b32fd1948db8459f.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nike</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These casual everyday sneakers make great running shoes because they’re comfortable, supportive, and are cushioned to catch the impact of each stride. The lace-up design helps you adapt the fit and snugness to your liking, and there are even removable insoles in case you need a specific level for arch support. Plus, if you like to run at night, there are reflective details on the sides of the shoes so you can easily be seen by traffic.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>12 | <strong>Structure: </strong>Neutral | <strong>Heel-to-Toe Drop: </strong>10 millimeters | <strong>Cushioned: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-investment-on-cloudboom-echo></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Investment</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>On Cloudboom Echo</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="On Cloudboom Echo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/OOSDnKLVBBj-uxH7E2ZCkmxKqbk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/OnCloudboomEcho-c639ea4deb844caf8f3d89be1d877e72.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>On</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re willing to invest in a good shoe for big running events like marathons, the Cloudboom Echo is the shoe you’ll want on race day. These are super lightweight with a design that helps your foot power off the ground for long strides. The outsole area grips the ground even when it’s slippery from rain or snow. The heel to toe drop of 9 millimeters gives plenty of cushioning to support your foot during long runs, and the sleek design will look fantastic as you cross the finish line.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>White/Black | <strong>Heel-to-Toe Drop: </strong>9 millimeters | <strong>Cushioned: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-design-on-cloudnova></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Design</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>On Cloudnova</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="On Cloudnova" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/7_E8RjOzuLKcMlHs_wlPTvv_Ozw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/OnCloudnova-51b6db14a4d44feb9e6bff8c6589aa85.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>On</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Finding the perfect everyday sneaker is the equivalent of scouting a hidden gem — and the Cloudnova is that shoe. “I got these shoes at the end of last year, and they’ve quickly become my go-to pair,” says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>PEOPLE Commerce Writer Madison Yauger</a>. “Whether I’m engaging in a fitness class or running around the city, these running shoes are comfortable and have an understated design that goes with literally every outfit.” These shoes have maximum cushioning (14-millimeter heel-to-toe drop) and come in a variety of colors.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>12 | <strong>Structure: </strong>Neutral | <strong>Heel-to-Toe Drop: </strong>14 millimeters | <strong>Cushioned: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cushioned-altra-running-via-olympus></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Cushioned</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Altra Running Via Olympus</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Altra VIA Olympus" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/FnZ89cV9P1yre-YoF2antWCRMRY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/altra-via-olympus-977a2482c4c84331bb9a716f345d012e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking for shoes that provide immense comfort throughout the day, these Altra shoes are highly cushioned to support your feet. “There’s nothing worse than a shoe that squeezes your foot in the wrong places, so I was relieved to find these Altra running shoes,” says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>PEOPLE senior commerce editor Erin Johnson</a>. “Not only do they fit my (slightly wide) foot perfectly, but they are cute enough to wear when I’m not exercising, too.” While there isn’t a heel-to-toe drop (the entire sole is cushioned), the underside has a stack height of 33 millimeters. The shoes are available in several colors and foot shape options so you can find the best fit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>4 | <strong>Structure: </strong>Neutral | <strong>Stack Height: </strong>33 millimeters | <strong>Cushioned: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-road-running-saucony-endorphin-speed-2></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Road Running</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Saucony Endorphin Speed 2</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=664 data-sizes=750px alt="Saucony Endorphin Speed 2 Road" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/2qHWXpe0OgUHEMIA9j30csuET2I=/fit-in/1500x664/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/SauconyEndorphinSpeed2Road-f0200dd90378470381885a7e482408f1.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>REI</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>favorite of Jennifer Garner</a>, these breathable shoes are highly versatile for different types of road running, whether a light jog down the sidewalk or a marathon run. The shoes have nylon plates to help your speed while running, and the design contributes to stability with sturdy tread. There aren’t as many color options, but the comfort level makes up for it with plenty of cushioning — the shoe has an 8-millimeter heel-to-toe drop. Or if you want a fun flashy shoe to wear with leggings and a sweatshirt, these sneakers are a great option.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>4 | <strong>Structure: </strong>Neutral | <strong>Heel-to-Toe Drop: </strong>8 millimeters | <strong>Cushioned: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-trails-hoka-challenger-6></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Trails</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hoka Challenger 6</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=800 data-sizes=750px alt="Hoka Challenger ATR 6" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/-1Oc4lbpUxvSaK9qRQbLrKyef9s=/fit-in/1500x800/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/HokaChallengerATR6-9fb60b9cf3314e7985bbe71d9616085a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Zappos</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our fitness expert loves Hoka shoes as a versatile option for many types of exercise and that includes trail running. The Challenger shoe offers a decent amount of cushioning but not enough that will cause an imbalance when you’re running on unleveled ground. The tread on these shoes has many divots to help grip the ground, making the Challenger a great shoe for hiking as well. The colors are also quite vibrant, so if you’re looking for shoes that stand out, this pair will pop against any fitness outfit you wear.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>10 | <strong>Heel-to-Toe Drop: </strong>5 millimeters | <strong>Cushioned: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-the-gym-hoka-womens-mach-5></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for the Gym</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hoka Mach 5</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1500 data-sizes=750px alt="Hoka Women's Mach 5 in black" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/ubsUfTeT4acT9klkk8wWsVhjc8Y=/fit-in/1500x1500/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/hokawomensmach5-de20ff4b681c472ebc50b1697433fbea.png"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Hoka</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>Those searching for versatile fitness shoes perfect for gym classes, road running, or other types of exercise</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For those who have taken up a new fitness routine, the Hoka Mach 5 shoes will be your best gym buddies. These shoes have a rubberized sole for lots of bounce (hello, jump squats), breathable mesh, and more material around the heel to hold your foot in place — which is perfect for HIIT workouts.

The Nike Free Flyknit shoes have almost a woven appearance on top, creating breathability for your feet.

The Blissfeel shoe has a huge cushion around the heel of the shoe, providing plenty of support and shock-absorption should you decide to go for a jog or walk, or try out an aerobics class with lots of impact movements.

Conversely, if you’re comfortable splurging for a good pair of running shoes, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">On Cloudboom Echo</a> is a solid investment, especially for bigger running events like marathons.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Type<strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When looking for running shoes, the type you buy will depend on its intended use. Do you need shoes to train for marathons, run through the park, or do jump-squats in your workout class? Different activities will be improved with the right shoe, so the type is important. With running shoes, the main three types are trail, road, and cross-trainer shoes. Marathon runners will want road shoes whereas those running through the woods will need shoes with more tread like trail shoes (the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Hoka Challenger ATR 6</a> is a great option). Cross-trainers are usually slightly more cushioned to shock-absorb when you’re jumping high and landing hard on your feet.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Design</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">How the shoe fits and feels can affect how well it works, so the design element is essential. “Naturally, everyone’s foot is designed differently and will require varying corrections,” says Stone. To find the most accurate fit, she recommends going to “a running shoe store that puts you on the treadmill and watches your gait to get a truly perfect fit.” Some design elements to consider are “arch and ankle support, shock absorbency, foot stability, and the functions they are supporting,” she says. And don’t forget about style — the visual design can be just as crucial to your decision, especially if you’ll be wearing these shoes daily.

If you’re looking for an in-between shoe that works well for both running and walking, Stone recommends Hoka.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>What are the three types of running shoes?</span></p><p>There are primarily three types of running shoes: trail, road, and cross-trainers. When looking for trail running shoes, Stone says you should “look for something that is forgiving in the landing for all different types of terrain.” That means something with plenty of support like “proper midsole construction” and a “rubber outsole that is sticky and durable” for any unstable ground.</p><p>For road-running, the key is “light and breathable shoes with proper heel support,” says Stone. Especially if you run with a heel-strike running technique, you should wear shoes with more padding on the sole and heel. And with cross-trainers, you’ll likely be doing more high-impact exercise, so this activity also requires stability, and “a thicker sole that supports lateral movements, providing you with more ankle support,” according to Stone.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>How often should you replace your running shoes?</span></p><p>Experts like Stone recommend replacing running shoes “every six to eight months depending on how often you run.” She suggests monitoring your steps as this marker will usually happen after running “around 300–500 miles.” Of course, if you primarily use your running shoes for walking or leisure, the lifespan will be quite a bit longer. “Be mindful of how your running shoes look and feel,” says Stone. “If you experience pain while running (while maintaining proper form) in shoes that you’ve had for a while, that usually means it’s time to go shopping.”</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-take-our-word-for-it></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Take Our Word For It</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Madison Yauger</a> is a seasoned commerce writer who’s tested hundreds of lifestyle products across all categories.
