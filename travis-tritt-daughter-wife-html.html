Sadly, by the time she mastered the song, her father was tired of hearing it.&nbsp;</p><p>But that did not mean that he'd stop supporting his daughter in her pursuit.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>For&nbsp;Tyler Reese Tritt, Music Is Family</h2><p>Tyler shared further along in the video that for her, music meant everything to her. It was family.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"Waylon Jennings held me when I was a baby," she flaunted before admitting that she always knew that country music was what she wanted to do.&nbsp;</p><p>Trying to put into words how the music made her feel, she couldn't go much further than claiming that she became a different person when she was performing.&nbsp;</p><p>I feel like I can just take over the world. It's an amazing feeling. It's something I can't get from anything else.</p><h2>Travis Tritt Let His Daughter Perform Alongside Him</h2><p>Being the doting dad that he is, Travis has always supported his child's&nbsp;dreams.&nbsp;With that being said, he did hold back on launching her as a child. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>As per reports from <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Countryfancast</a>, Travis' wife Theresa Nelson Tritt confirmed that&nbsp;Disney and <a href=# rel=follow>Nickelodeon</a> wanted to sign Tyler early on, but Travis wouldn't agree to it.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Instead, he gave her the time to hone her skills as a performer and let her perform under his wing as often as he could.&nbsp;</p><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><strong>Travis Tritt singing for&nbsp;Tyler Reese Tritt as a kid </strong>(Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The first time that the father-daughter duo performed for the public was on Father's Day&nbsp;2013.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The two of them came together to sing a cover of&nbsp;Patty Smyth and Don Henley's hit, 'Sometimes Love Just Ain't Enough.'</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Tyler Reese Tritt's Debut Single</h2><p>On November 3, 2017, Tyler got out from under her father's caring wings and set out on her own with the release of her debut single 'Perfect' with Post Oak Recordings.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The song was produced by Jesse Owen Astin and co-written by Astin, Adam Folsom, and Dionne Osborne.</p><p>On a later date, she shared that the sole intent behind the song was to form a connection with her audiences.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>"I want everyone to hear it and say, 'that reminds me of my first love,'" she affirmed,&nbsp;"That common thread of the excitement of a first love, the heartache, and feeling that never really leaves even with the passing of time."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKyilsOqv4ytqaKspGKxosHGoaueql2stqexjaGrpqQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./6e921762-c58c-c636-141e-e740344af997.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Watch Criminal Minds Season 10 Episode 2: Burn">&larr;
