In the 1970s and 1980s, the comic rose to national prominence by performing on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, and in various Showtime specials. Gallagher achieved prominence with his hallmark routine, “Sledge-O-Matic,” in which he smashed food on stage with a big mallet before finishing with the main act — a watermelon. It rapidly became the comedian’s most famous comedy and a popular topic for imitation.</p><p>Craig Marquardo, his former manager, broke the news of his death, saying that the comic “succumbed to his infirmities” at his California home. The statement went on to say:</p><p>“He was the number one comic in America for 15 years, thanks in part to the success of his stand-up specials appearing on MTV in its early days, which introduced him to an altogether new audience.”</p><p>Following the news of Gallagher’s passing, many admirers flocked to Twitter to express their respects.</p><h2>Gallagher’s childhood and meteoric climb to prominence</h2><p>Gallagher, a native of Fort Bragg, North Carolina, graduated from the University of South Florida with a degree in chemical engineering before coming to Los Angeles and honing his comedic act at the famed club The Comedy Store. He made his television debut in 1975 on ABC’s The Jim Stafford Show.&nbsp;He appeared on The Mike Douglas Show in 1978. The next year, he appeared on The Merv Griffin Show. Furthermore, during his career, the comic has been on several talk shows, including The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, Match Game, David Letterman’s NBC and CBS shows, and Howard Stern’s TV and radio programs. He has appeared on MTV and Comedy Central.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Leo-Gallagher.jpg alt="Leo Gallagher" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>During his nearly 50-year career, the prolific entertainer has racked up a stunning 17 comedy specials. In the upcoming film Weird: The Al Yankovic Story, comedian Paul F. Tompkins plays him. Gallagher also starred in a Geico commercial in the film The Book Of Daniel in his senior year. Gallagher was one of more than 100 candidates in the 2003 recall election for California governor, which Arnold Schwarzenegger won. Gallagher finished 16th out of 135 candidates, with 5,466 votes.</p><h2>Netizens expressed their shock at the comedian’s death on Twitter.</h2><p>Gallagher died from organ failure while accompanied by his family in Palm Springs, California, according to a statement issued by Marquardo to The Rolling Stones. He was supposedly sick and had many heart attacks. As word of his passing spread on the internet, countless Twitter users started to pay respect to the iconic comic.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Crazy, funny, and entertaining.

His younger brother Ron, who became a comedian after receiving Leo’s first approval, began his career as Leo’s impersonator. In 2000, the latter successfully sued Ron for trademark infringement and fraudulent advertising. As a result, Ron was forbidden from utilizing his brother’s procedures.&nbsp;In recent years, Leo Gallagher has been more controversial for misrepresenting Mexicans and making racist and homophobic remarks. He even stormed out of an interview with Marc Maron in 2011 after being asked about his views.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Leo-Gallagher-1.jpg alt="Leo Gallagher" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Gallagher was last included in Comedy Central’s list of the 100 Greatest Stand-ups of All Time in 2004. He informed the Oregonian’s Ed Condran about his discontent with his low rank:</p><p>“I produced 13 one-hour Showtime specials, which are accessible on VHS.” “I developed the cable one-man show.”</p><p>Gallagher spent most of his career touring the United States until the Covid-19 outbreak struck. Following that, he took advantage of the hiatus to spend time with his son, Barnaby, and daughter Aimee, the latter of whom had featured with him on his specials as a youngster.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGijnqddnK6tuMCgn56qXZZ6pLvMnpuimZ5ivaK%2F0p6bZpmnlsZurdNmq6GdXZa0pnnOn2Rwbl8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ricky-on-90-day-fiance.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ricky on 90 Day Fiance">&larr;
