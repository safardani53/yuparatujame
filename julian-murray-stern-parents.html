His mother is Lisa Kudrow, best known for her role as Phoebe Buffay in the TV show, Friends.&nbsp;</p><p>His father, Michel Stern, is a famous French advertising executive. Here is all we know about Julian, including his biography, parents, education, and net worth.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Julian Murray Stern’s biography</h2><p>Julian was born on May 7, 1998, in the USA. At the time of writing, his age is 25.&nbsp;</p><p>He is a tall man, with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">height</a> around 5 feet 9 inches tall and weighing about 68 kg. His hair is brown, and he has hazel eyes.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Apart from this, no other facts exist on his other physical measurements, such as clothing size, shoe size, biceps, chest, waist, and hip measurements.</p><p>Kudrow was pregnant with her son when she was filming Friends. As a result, her pregnancy is written into the show.&nbsp;</p><p>The plot of Friends’ fourth and fifth seasons featured Kudrow’s actual pregnancy as Buffay, her character, was used as a surrogate for her brother Frank and his wife Alice. Kudrow talked about her happy recollections from that time in her life with her costars in an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">People</a>.</p><p>Referring to her co-stars, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jennifer Aniston</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Courteney Cox</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Matt LeBlanc</a>, Matthew Perry, and David Schwimmer, Kudrow said that the six of them would huddle backstage and say, “All right, have a good show, love you love you love you love you.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>When they realized that Kudrow was pregnant with Julian, they would say, “Have a great show, love you love you — love you, little Julian!” Kudrow knew what he wanted to name her son so it was easier for them to include him.</p><p>Kudrow mentioned how sweet it was that her best friends included her son. Being dotting parents, Kudrow, and her partner often took Julian with them when they could.</p><p>This included the actress bringing Julian to the set of Friends when he was young. As a result, he was familiar with the cast members and often mistook Aniston for his mother.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Kudrow explained Julian’s bond with Aniston in an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CONAN</a>. Whenever he saw Aniston, he would fly into her lap.</p><p>She said, “Well, she’s a love bug, and that made sense. And I was always glad for anyone that Julian felt love for and felt from. But then at home, she’d be on TV, and he’d go, ‘Mommy!’”</p><p>She joked that she suspected Julian and Aniston had a special bond that she did not share with her own son. However, she was happy for both of them and loved their bond.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Julian does not have any siblings and he is the only son of his parents. Kudrow mentioned that Julian wanted to be a single child from a young age.</p><p>She told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Page Six</a> in 2017 that he did not want to have any siblings, and he is thankful to his parents for that. She said, “[He] made it clear from the moment he could speak that he didn’t want a brother or sister … [and] it just worked out that way anyway — but to this day, he’ll say, ‘Thank you’.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Julian Murray Stern’s education and graduation</h2><p>Julian’s education and schooling are unknown. However, according to his Instagram, he studied Bachelor of Fine Arts in Cinematic Arts, Film & Television Production at the University of Southern California (USC).</p><p>He graduated from the university in 2021.

She congratulated her son on his accomplishment by posting a picture on Instagram.&nbsp;</p><p>With his mother in his arms, Stern looked proudly at her while donning his black gown and cap. Kudrow said in the caption of the photo how pleased she was with the 25-year-old.&nbsp;</p><p>She also acknowledged that she had shed a few tears seeing her son get his education and graduate from USC. On his personal Instagram, Julian also posted a few photos of himself.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Julian-Stern.jpeg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Julian Stern Murray graduated from USC in 2021.

More like easy A! Haha- no just kidding it was a lot of work I’m proud to have graduated from here.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Julian Murray Stern’s net worth</h2><p>Since Julian started studying at USC, his career in the film business took off. His junior thesis, Mind Made Up, marked his directorial debut in 2019.</p><p>He <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced</a> on Instagram on May 8, 2021, that the Portland Comedy Festival had chosen his thesis video.

He wrote, “I want to give a visual representation of what I believe hate looks like in a person, how it controls one’s life, and the result of those who let anger consume them that I believe can best be shown through animation.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Julian is a very passionate storyteller. He wrote in his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a> how he discovered that visual storytelling was the best method for him to convey himself.</p><p>He wrote, “Whether that is being on stage, working behind a camera, or sitting in an editing studio- telling a story, however I can is what brings me the most the joy in the world.”</p><p>He claimed that he wanted to work in this industry so that he could immerse myself fully in the world of cinema and television and cooperate with as many individuals as possible who have something to say or a narrative to tell.</p><p>Since he is just getting started in the industry, his net worth has not been revealed. However, various tabloids have reported it to be around six figures.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6yfnl6YvK57wJyrqKpfn8KttcCnZKatoqeuunnSrZyrpl2lrrOxza2qaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./peter-cushing-19130526-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Peter Cushing (Movie Actor) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More">&larr;
