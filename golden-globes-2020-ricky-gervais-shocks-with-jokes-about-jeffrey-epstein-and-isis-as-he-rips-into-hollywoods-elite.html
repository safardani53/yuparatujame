He was also in the movie Cats, but nobody saw that.</p><p>You're in no position to lecture the public about anything. You know nothing about the real world. Most of you spent less time in school than Greta Thunberg.</p><p>Apple roared into the TV game with 'The Morning Show', a drama about the importance of dignity and doing the right thing - made by a company that runs sweatshops in China</p><p>I came in a limo tonight and the license plate was made by Felicity Huffman.</p><p>[Afterlife] is a show about a man who wants to kill himself because his wife died of cancer and it's still more fun than this. Spoiler alert, season two is on the way so he didn't kill himself...just like Jeffrey Epstein. I know he's your friend, I don't care.</p><p>[Birdbox is] a movie where people survive by acting like they don't see a thing. Sort of like working for Harvey Weinstein.</p><p>It was a big year for paedophile movies. Surviving R Kelly, Leaving Neverland, Two Popes</p><p>He also made gags about the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, Leo DiCaprio's love life and Felicity Huffman's prison sentence for her part in a college admissions scandal.</p><p>During a seven-minute monologue, the host mocked DiCaprio’s fondness for dating women in their early twenties, leading to a gag about Prince Andrew's sex allegations.</p><p>Ricky said: 'Once Upon a Time In Hollywood [is] nearly three hours long. Leonardo DiCaprio attended the premiere and by the end his date was too old for him.'</p><p>And he followed the gag by saying: 'Even Prince Andrew is like, ''come on Leo mate, you're nearly 50, son''.'</p><p>The host began his speech saying: "Kevin Hart was fired from the Oscars for some offensive tweets. Lucky for me, the Hollywood Foreign Press can barely speak English so I got this gig."</p><p>Ricky continued: "You all look lovely, all dolled up. You came here in your limos... I came here in a limo and the license plate was made by Felicity Huffman."</p><p>He then joked: "It was a big year for paedophile movies, Surviving R. Kelly... Two Popes."</p><p>Each joke was met with a mix of laughter, awkward pauses and several faces of pure shock.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NINTCHDBPICT000551910859.jpg><p>At one point, Ricky joked: "No one cares about movies anymore, no one goes to cinema, no one watches network TV. Everyone’s watching Netflix. This show should just be me coming out, you win everything, Netflix, good night."</p><p>He continued: "No, we drag it out three hours you could binge watch Afterlife instead of watching this show. That’s a show about a man who wants to kill himself because his wife dies of cancer and it’s still more fun than this.</p><p>"OK spoiler alert, season two is on the way, so in the end obviously he didn’t kill himself just like Jeffrey Epstein."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NINTCHDBPICT000551911601.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/RB-GOLDEN-GLOBES-WINNERS-LIST-FILMS-PART1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/RB-GOLDEN-GLOBES-WINNERS-LIST-FILMS-PART2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/RB-GOLDEN-GLOBES-WINNERS-LIST-TV-PART1-v4.jpg><p>As the room made a loud audible reaction, he continued: "Shut up. I know he’s your friend, but I don’t care you have to make your own way here, your own plane, didn’t you? But seriously, most films are awful, lazy."</p><p>Another quip say him say: "In this room are some of the most important TV and film executives in the world, and they are all terrified of Ronan Farrow – he’s coming for you."</p><p>He continued: "If you win, come up, accept your little award, thank your agent and your God and f*** off."</p><p>Things had a much softer tone later in the show when Tom Hanks accepted the Cecil B. Demille Award at the Golden Globes.</p><p>Hanks accepted the award from presenter Charlize Theron after a clips package that began with his second career role in 1980 on the schlocky TV series “The Love Boat.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NINTCHDBPICT000551925646.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NINTCHDBPICT000551925638-e1578301583826.jpg><p>“Most of the people in this room, I would pay to see them to get their cars washed,” Hanks said to open his speech, then asked the crowd of Hollywood luminaries for a show of hands. “Can I just say honestly, really, really, tell the truth now, how many people in this room have a clip package that includes ‘The Love Boat?’”</p><p>After apologizing for having a cold, Hanks looked at one of the front tables at the Beverly Hilton, and immediately turned around, leaving many in attendance confused.</p><p>He turned back around with tears in his eyes.</p><p>“A man is blessed with a family sitting down front like that,” He said to wife Rita Wilson and his kids at the table with her. “I can’t tell you how much your love means to me.”</p><p>He shifted from laughs to tears throughout the rest of the speech.</p><p>“It’s the cold,” he said after breaking down again.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NINTCHDBPICT000551917493-e1578301613114.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NINTCHDBPICT000551920881-1.jpg><p>Elsewhere on the night, Phoebe Waller-Bridge bagged her first two Golden Globe awards during Sunday night's ceremony as she received nods for her hit show Fleabag.</p><p>In true style, the British actress made a very cheeky quip thanking Barack Obama for praising the show, despite the fact Fleabag pleasures herself to a video of the former US president.</p><p>The British actress and writer won one of the first gongs of the night as she was crowned for Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series - Musical or Comedy.</p><p>Phoebe, 34, made a typically modest speech as she admitted: "Thank you, this is really heavy and cool."</p><p>She continued: "This all comes down to Andrew Scott really because... that man!</p><p>"There is a lot of talk about the chemistry between us, but he can have chemistry with a pebble. So I’m really glad to have been your pebble tonight."</p><p>She then made a cheeky quip about the show’s small budget at the hands of Amazon and BBC as she thanked the cast and crew that worked alongside her on the breakout comedy series.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MORE GOLDEN GLOBES NEWS</h2></p><p>The lavish awards ceremony is the first big event in the Hollywood calendar and is believed to influence the outcome of the Academy awards as Oscar nomination voting closes just days after the Globes.</p><p>Hosted by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, a non-profit organisation of showbiz journalist and photographers, the ceremony was created in 1943 to award critically-acclaimed films and TV shows.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hqYWyCd4KOoKalnJWjeqi4zpucrGViZX9xedGimqSxXZyys8LAoqpmq5iksKy%2FjLCgraBdn7yssdJmmJunpal6q7HFn6mesV2avbTAxKKlZpmemXqqv8isZJqrXZ2ybr7IqapmoZ6pvG60zqWjsq%2BfpLG0ecSloK2dXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./patrice-rushen.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Patrice Rushen">&larr;
