He then welcomed a son, Tracy Jr., 32, with ex-girlfriend Darlene Ortiz in 1991. Two decades later, Ice-T welcomed his third child, daughter Chanel Nicole, 8, in 2015 with his wife <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Coco Austin</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Together, Ice-T and Coco's parenting style has made some headlines, but the rapper stays firm in his belief that "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>everyone parents differently</a>."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"You have to be out of your mind to care what someone else has to say," Ice-T told PEOPLE. "Our parenting is a lot different than the normal, square couple from Oklahoma. I'm a f---ing rock star, it’s different."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He added: "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>We’re like the Osbournes</a>. We have a different dynamic in our house. But it's not harmful. That's the main thing. It's us."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ice-T and Coco have opted to raise Chanel without any help from a nanny. He <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>called his wife a "super mom"</a> while talking to PEOPLE in December 2023.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If you're fortunate enough to be able to stay home with your kids, it's the most incredible and most admirable thing you can do, is raise a child," he said. "So don't let no woman make you feel any kind of way. Do that job. So she picks Chanel up, goes to school, brings her back, takes her to Kung Fu, takes her to all that stuff."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Ice-T's older, now-adult children prefer to stay out of the spotlight, 8-year-old Chanel tends to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>steal it from her famous parents</a>, who often share glimpses of their daughter's sassy personality on social media.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In February 2023, all three of Ice-T's children gathered for their dad's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony</a>. The Law & Order actor, who was joined on stage by Chanel, gave his family credit for his success.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Let me shout out my family," he said during his acceptance speech. "My son, my daughter, Coco my wife. [Chanel], who obviously is in the position to stand behind one of these podiums one day. She has no fear of the stage."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading for everything there is to know about Ice-T's three children.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-letesha-marrow-47></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>LeTesha Marrow</strong>, 47</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Rob Kim/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ice-T had his first daughter, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>LeTesha Marrow</a>, while he was still in high school. LeTesha was born on March 20, 1976, to mom Adrienne, who was Ice-T's girlfriend at the time, though there is little public information about her.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The rapper later reflected on having kids at a young age, admitting that he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>wasn't as focused on parenthood</a> back then.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When I had my first kid I was in the middle of the wildness of becoming Ice-T, all the people that were after me, and I had my head down," he told PEOPLE in 2016. "I really wasn't concentrating on them, I was concentrating on survival."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 1995, LeTesha welcomed her son, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Elyjah Marrow</a>, making Ice-T a first-time grandfather. Though LeTesha mostly avoids the spotlight, she has appeared on several episodes of her dad's reality show Ice Loves Coco along with her son.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2015, at the age of 19, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>LeTesha's son Elyjah was arrested</a> after he accidentally shot and killed his roommate, Daryus Johnson. Elyjah was later <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>indicted on various charges</a>, including involuntary manslaughter, possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, possession of marijuana more than an ounce, theft by receiving stolen property and possession of firearm during commission of a felony reckless conduct.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-tracy-marrow-jr-32></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Tracy Marrow Jr.</strong>, 32</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Scott Dudelson/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ice-T and then-girlfriend <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Darlene Ortiz</a> welcomed their son, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Tracy Marrow Jr.</a>, on Nov. 23, 1991. Ice-T met Ortiz on the set of the film Breakin' in 1984 and the two dated for 17 years before calling it quits in 2000.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Tracy Jr., also known as "Lil' Ice," has followed in his dad's footsteps by pursuing a career in music. He is a member of Ice-T's heavy metal band <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Body Count</a> and has <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>performed</a> with his father on stage on various occasions.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a 2015 interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Complex</a>, Ortiz spoke about the similarities between her son and his dad. "I couldn't even think of anybody that can top his dad, but he is so much more than his dad," she said. "Ice would take up anything and master it. But this one? His little seed, this kid. It's been so entertaining.

He continued, "It's like Disneyland. I can't say, 'You don't want to go, all the rides suck.' You gotta go for the rides."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite wanting to wait to have kids, Coco believed being a mother was her destiny.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm 100 percent all-in," she said at the time. "I think motherhood was always my calling. I wish I had let it happen earlier, but this is perfect.

She then made her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>New York Fashion Week debut</a> alongside her parents when she was 1.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now 8 years old, Chanel is a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>natural performer</a>, according to her parents. "She watches Daddy at the concerts that he has all the time — she sees him move with the microphone, so now she knows how to talk on the microphone and give it up to the audience," Coco told PEOPLE in 2017.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Coco often dresses herself and Chanel in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>matching outfits</a> — from everyday wear to Halloween costumes and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>bikinis</a>. But despite coordinating looks with her mom, Chanel is her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>dad's mini-me</a>, and fans regularly point out the resemblance between the two on social media.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ice-T and Coco have faced online backlash for some of their parenting choices, including letting Chanel have <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>nail tips</a> for her school picture day and Coco's decision to continue <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>breastfeeding her</a>. But the couple doesn't let the hate get to them — after receiving criticism for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>bathing Chanel in a kitchen sink</a>, Coco defended her "unconventional" parenting style on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4>Twitter</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Wow just Wow!

Some may want to take some pointers rather than rag on me!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite putting up a strong front, Coco has been open about the difficulties of "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>being under a microscope</a>" and how she struggles with mom shaming. During an appearance on The Tamron Hall Show, the model got emotional after watching a video Ice-T had made her, in which he praised her skills as a mother.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm underneath a microscope all the time and you don't hear what good you do," she told Hall as she teared up. "You don't hear the goodness, you just hear a lot of bad. And I know I'm a good mother."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She continued, "I've dedicated the last six years, putting everything aside, my career, everything, just for her ...

Who is the perfect parent?" Ice-T told PEOPLE in 2018. "Parenting is a work in progress and all kids are different. People need to mind their business and worry about their kids.

Shortly after welcoming Chanel, Ice-T told PEOPLE that he was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>obsessed with taking pictures</a> of his daughter, despite vowing he would never be that type of dad.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-82 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm taking a lot of pictures.
