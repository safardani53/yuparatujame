an emerald green tunic by Catherine Walker and a navy patterned scarf by Satrangi, another local designer, and earrings by the country's firm Zeen, interjected: “You stuck with it.”</span></p><p><span>The Prime Minister was recalling his friendship with Diana when journalists were allowed into his chamber for a few seconds to see the royal couple meeting him today at his official residence in Islamabad.</span></p><p><span>They spoke about one of the places that the royal couple will visit tomorrow — the destination is currently under wraps — and Mr Khan said he thought Diana might have been there before.</span></p><p><span>Mr Khan, who was married to Diana's friend Jemima Goldsmith between 1995 and 2004, uses the residence — known simply as The Prime Minister’s House — for official entertaining, but he actually lives in his private house on the outskirts of the capital.</span></p><img
