From <a href=# rel=follow>Morgan Freeman</a> to <a href=# rel=follow>Trevor Noah</a>, various celebrities appeared in the movie.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Moreover, several other people made secret cameos but were not spotted. One of them was the Snipes family. Yup, his wife and kids made appearances on it.</p><h2>The Snipes' Family In The Movie</h2><p>Snipes has five kids with two wives. He has a son with his first spouse,&nbsp;April Dubois, whereas he shares four children with his current wife, Nakyung "Nikki" Park.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Wesley Snipes as General Izzi in Coming 2 America. </strong>(Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>While having a conversation with <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Fatherly</a> in March 2021,&nbsp;Snipes talked about his role in Coming 2 America. The actor played the role of General Izzi, the leader of Nexdoria.&nbsp;</p><p>General Izzi is a funny yet fearsome man who cares a lot about his kids. Snipes said that the General was "definitely a loving dad" who does not mean to be funny but is.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The actor credited his children for being the inspiration behind General Izzi. He said that his character was the reflection of his kids&nbsp;and "their influence and impact" on him.&nbsp;</p><p>He said the timing, humor, nuances - everything was because of the kids. Moreover, he gushed that&nbsp;his joy "is a reflection of them and their effect" on him.&nbsp;</p><p>He revealed that his family was in the movie in the same interview. He did not reveal if they were together but said they were all in one particular scene.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p></p><p><strong>Wesley Snipes with his second wife,&nbsp;Nakyung "Nikki" Park.</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Wikimedia Commons</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Wesley Snipes' Wife and Children</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Snipes and his first wife, Dubois, got married in 1985. It is reported that the two were high school sweethearts, and&nbsp;they dated for a long time before tying the knot.&nbsp;</p><p>The two were blessed with a son named Jelani in 1988. When he was one year old, he made a cameo in his father's movie,&nbsp;Mo' Better Blues.</p><p>Unfortunately, the marriage did not last long. The two separated and got a divorce in 1990.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Thirteen years later, Snipes married his second spouse, Park, in 2003 in a private ceremony.</p><p>They allegedly met each other in the late 90s&nbsp;and dated for approximately three years before marrying.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Park is South Korean, and she is the daughter of&nbsp;Park Cheol,&nbsp;a South Korean television producer.&nbsp;While Cheol is no more, the actor appreciates and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">praises</a> his father-in-law.</p><p><br><strong>Wesley Snipes and wife&nbsp;Nakyung "Nikki" Park at&nbsp;Festival du Cin√©ma de Venise.&nbsp;</strong>(Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Wikimedia Commons</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>He died in 2020, and&nbsp;in his eulogy, Snipes said Cheol was responsible for leading South Korea "to the forefront of cultural history." He was also there for his wife&nbsp;to mourn her father's death.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Park's father and husband are heavily invested in the entertainment industry, but she did not choose that career. She is a painter who often exhibits her work in various exhibitions.&nbsp;</p><p>She also often uploads her projects on her social media. Park and Snipes had their first son, Akhenaten Kihwa-T, before their marriage in 2000.&nbsp;</p><p>They welcomed their daughter, Iset Jua-T, on July 31, 2001, and their second son, Alaafia Jehu-T, on May 26, 2004.
