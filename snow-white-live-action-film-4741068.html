The 1937 animated film,&nbsp;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, has been remade into an upcoming live-action film produced by Walt Disney Pictures. Snow White’s story has been portrayed in live-action before by <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Lily Collins</a>&nbsp;</strong>in 2012’s&nbsp;Mirror Mirror&nbsp;and by&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Kristen Stewart</a>&nbsp;</strong>in 2012’s&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Snow White and the Huntsman</a>. Those films also featured Snow’s iconic antagonist, the Evil Queen, who will also appear in the upcoming film.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Snow White&nbsp;was actually Disney’s first animated feature and is still so beloved by fans. This live-action film has been in the works since 2016, so there’s a ton of hype for it — and major controversy. Disney made a major announcement about the live-action movie’s release date in October 2023. Sorry, Snow White fans. The movie’s big screen release has been delayed. <strong>HollywoodLife&nbsp;</strong>has rounded up everything we know so far about the next Snow White, including the cast, release date, and more.</p><h2>Snow White Live-Action Movie Release Date</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Snow White‘s release date has been delayed to March 21, 2025, according to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety</a>. The film’s release date was pushed almost a year to the day.&nbsp;The movie was originally supposed to be released in theaters on March 22, 2024. Disney has not revealed when the movie will be available on Disney+, but it will likely be after the film’s theatrical run.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/snow-white-live-action-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>After Rachel and Gal’s casting was officially announced, production on the live-action remake kicked off in March 2022. Filming briefly paused when <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a fire damaged the production set</a> at Pinewood Studios in England. Gal <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>confirmed</a> in April 2022 that she finished filming her scenes, which include musical numbers. Filming concluded in July 2022.</p><h2>Who Is Playing Snow White?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Rachel Zegler</strong> </a>is the lucky actress playing Snow White in the live-action adaptation. She made her onscreen debut in <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><b>Steven Spielberg</b></a>‘s&nbsp;2021 remake of&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>West Side Story</a>. She starred opposite <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ansel Elgort</strong></a> and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ariana DeBose</strong></a> and won the Golden Globe for Best Actress — Motion Picture Comedy or Musical.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Snow-White-Live-Action-rachel-zegler-ss-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Rachel’s casting in&nbsp;Snow White&nbsp;was officially announced in June 2021. “Rachel’s extraordinary vocal abilities are just the beginning of her gifts,” director <strong>Marc Webb</strong> said in a <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>statement</a>. She also posted on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>, “Well… hello to a dream come true.” She later cut her hair into a short bob to play the Disney princess.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Rachel, who is Latina, faced unfair backlash for being cast in the lead role in Snow White,&nbsp;which she discussed on&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety’s&nbsp;Actors on Actors</a> series with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Andrew Garfield</strong></a>&nbsp;in January 2022.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>“Never in a million years did I imagine that this would be a possibility for me. You don’t normally see Snow Whites that are of Latin descent,” she said in the interview. “You don’t particularly see people who look like me or are me playing roles like that. When it was announced, it was a huge thing that was trending on Twitter for days, because all of the people were angry. We need to love them in the right direction. At the end of the day, I have a job to do that I’m really excited to do. I get to be a Latina princess.”</p><h2>Rachel Zegler Backlash</h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>The movie hasn’t been released, and it’s already stirred up tons of debate. In recent months, past interviews Rachel Zegler did about the live-action adaptation resurfaced and went viral online. When the actress was asked about the live-action movie’s “modern edge” take on Snow White, Rachel told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety</a>, “I just mean that it’s no longer 1937. She’s not going to be saved by the prince and she’s not going to be dreaming about true love. She’s dreaming about becoming the leader she knows she can be and the leader that her late father told her that she could be if she was fearless, fair, brave, and true.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Extra</a>, Rachel criticized the love story in Snow White & The Seven Dwarfs. “The original cartoon came out in 1937, and very evidently so. There’s a big focus on her love story with a guy who literally stalks her. Weird! Weird! So we didn’t do that this time,” she said. Rachel also joked that all of <strong>Andrew Burnap’s</strong> scenes “could get cut.” Andrew plays a new male character in the film. The resurfaced interview clips have sparked an intense backlash against Rachel, with people criticizing Rachel’s condemnation of the original film’s love story.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>i hope the world becomes kinder</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>— rachel zegler (she/her/hers) (@rachelzegler) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>August 11, 2023</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>i love you very much. forever and ever. remember to be kind. treat each other with patience and empathy. remember that you are loved unconditionally, no matter your mistakes, no matter your misunderstandings. you deserve it. you deserve love. you deserve to live without fear. x</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>— rachel zegler (she/her/hers) (@rachelzegler) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>August 12, 2023</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-18><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rachel cryptically responded</a> to the backlash in messages she posted on Twitter/X. “I hope the world becomes kinder,” she wrote at first.

Remember that you are loved unconditionally, no matter your mistakes, no matter your misunderstandings. You deserve it. You deserve love. You deserve to live without fear. x.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-19><strong>David Hand</strong>, the son of an animator who helped direct the original movie, slammed Disney’s “woke” remake of the 1937 classic. “I mean, it’s a whole different concept, and I just totally disagree with it, and I know my dad and Walt would also very much disagree with it,” he told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Telegraph</a>. He added that it’s a “bit insulting” what Disney has done with the “classic films. David continued, “There’s no respect for what Disney did and what my dad did… I think Walt and he would be turning in their graves.”</p><h2>Snow White Cast and Crew</h2><p id=content-paragraph-20>Rachel will star opposite&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Gal Gadot</strong></a>, who is playing the Evil Queen. Gal is best known for playing Wonder Woman in various films in the DC Extended Universe, including <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Wonder Woman</a>, the sequel&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Wonder Woman 1984</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Justice League</a>.

Walt Disney Pictures is producing and distributing the remake.</p><h2>Snow White Plot Details</h2><p id=content-paragraph-23>The live-action Snow White is expected to “expand upon the story and music from the beloved animated classic,” according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Hollywood Reporter</a>. The film will include “new songs” similar to the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>live-action remake of The Little Mermaid</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-24>The story of Snow White comes from the 1812 fairytale by the <strong>Brothers Grimm</strong>. The live-action movie is an adaptation of the 1937 animated film, which was loosely based on the fairytale. Expected to see the magic mirror, the poisoned apple, and the glass coffin, and more in the remake.</p><p id=content-paragraph-25>More details about the plot are not currently known.&nbsp;Disney debuted the first trailer at the D23 Expo in September 2022, but the footage has not been released wide. Rachel’s amazing reaction was caught on video, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>which you can see here.</a> She teared up at the crowd’s response! “I didn’t even see it! I didn’t see what you guys saw!” she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/snow-white-live-action-embed4.jpg><h2>Snow White Controversy</h2><p id=content-paragraph-26>Snow’s allies, the Seven Dwarfs, are expected to appear in the live-action adaptation. However, the film has come under fire by <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Game of Thrones</a>&nbsp;alum <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Peter Dinklage</strong></a>, who has a form of dwarfism. He criticized the remake during an interview on <strong>Marc Maron</strong>‘s podcast in January 2022. “It makes no sense to me. You’re progressive in one way, but then you’re still making that f**king backwards story about seven dwarfs living in a cave together, what the f**k are you doing, man?” Peter <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>said</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-27>Disney responded to his criticism in a statement and said “to avoid reinforcing stereotypes from the original animated film, we are taking a different approach with these seven characters and have been consulting with members of the dwarfism community.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9KnprBlp522tbGMpaCvnV2WsLW1zqdkn6Gconp1g5NqZ29wXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./queen-naijas-boyfriend-list.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Queen Naija Dating  Queen Naija's Boyfriend &amp;amp; Exes">&larr;
