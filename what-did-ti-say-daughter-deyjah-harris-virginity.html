"Deyjah’s 18, just graduated high school now and she’s attending her first year of college, figuring it out for herself.</p><p>"And yes, not only have we had the conversation [about sex], we have yearly trips to the gynecologist to check her hymen."</p><p>Hosts Nazanin Mandi and Nadia Moham initially thought T.I. was joking before he went into more disturbing detail.</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Atlanta</a> musician said he began taking Deyjah to the "gyno" after her 16th birthday and it's become a yearly tradition.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/06/NINTCHDBPICT000589899375.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/06/NINTCHDBPICT000589898601.jpg><p>"Right after the birthday we celebrate," he said. "Usually like the day after the party, she's enjoying her gifts. I put a sticky note on the door: 'Gyno. Tomorrow. 9:30.'"</p><p>Deyjah is forced to sign a form to share this confidential medical information with him.</p><p>"I'm like, 'Deyjah, they want you to sign this ... so we can share information," T.I. said.&nbsp;"'Is there anything you would not want me to know?' 'See doc? No problem.'"</p><p>The outspoken rapper said he's adamant about the check up – even though medics pointed out that bike riding, athletics, horseback riding, and athletic physical activity can break the hymen:</p><p>"So I say, 'Look doc, she don’t ride no horses, she don't ride no bike, she don’t play no sports. Just check the hymen please and give me back my results expeditiously."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/06/NINTCHDBPICT000589897825.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/06/NINTCHDBPICT000590357083.png><h2>What was Deyjah Harris’ reaction?</h2><p>Deyjah has since said that she was humiliated and upset by her dad's comments.</p><p>She said her relationship with T.I. has been damaged because he insists on monitoring her virginity.</p><p>During an episode of Friends & Family Hustle, the 18-year-old revealed T.I. praises her brothers for having sex and broke down in tears.</p><p>Deyjah said she was "shocked, hurt, angry, embarrassed" when she first saw the topic trending on social media during a family vacation.</p><p>The teenager said she was trying not to think about the situation because she knew it wasn't "healthy."</p><p>"This situation is just a little traumatizing for me," she said tearfully. "I need more time to figure out what I want to say, but things are completely awkward and uncomfortable between me and my Dad.</p><p>"Prior to all of this happening, our relationship was pretty decent, but after all of this, it’s changed, honestly."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/06/NINTCHDBPICT000589897240.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-17-at-9.32.55-AM.png><h2>Has T.I. apologized?</h2><p>Initially, T.I. claimed that he was joking before his apology.</p><p>During a <span>Red Table Talk</span>&nbsp;interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jada Pinkett Smith</a>, the rapper said he was never in the exam room.</p><p>He said the check up only happened when Deyjah was 15 or 16.</p><p>T.I. said the backlash stemmed from a conversation he had in "a very joking manner" about modern parenting.</p><p>“From a place of truth, I began to embellish and exaggerate and I think a lot of people took it extremely literal," he said.</p><p>“I am incredibly apologetic to her for that. Not to any of these other strangers, or any other weirdos who just tossed lies around for fun.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-17-at-9.35.34-AM.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/06/NINTCHDBPICT000589897998.jpg><p>Following <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kobe Bryant's death</a>&nbsp;back in January,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> the rapper again apologized to his daughter on social media</a>.</p><p>"Please forgive me for any and all imperfections that cause misunderstandings between us," he said. "Charge my mind, not my heart."</p><p>The 39-year-old continued: "I love you girls more than my vocabulary will allow me to express. You have grown so much right before my very eyes & blossomed into strong, brilliantly opinionated, independent young women.</p><p>"I'm so proud of you both and I love you to no end, more than you'll ever know."</p><p>In the emotive post, he assured his daughters, who have different mothers, that he would "catch you when you fall."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/NINTCHDBPICT000537512570.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Deb.jpg><h2>What were the reactions to T.I.’s comments?</h2><p>Dr Jennifer Gunter, a gynacologist known for dispelling vaginal myths, branded T.I's comments as "disgusting" and "horrible."</p><p>She schooled her followers, and the Georgia rapper, about the hymen in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">detailed Twitter thread</a> that rapidly went viral.</p><p>"Yes, the hymen is like baby teeth. It served a biological purpose for a narrow developmental window and then when no longer needed is discarded," the doctor wrote.</p><p>"The hymen is no virginity indicator, 50 per cent of sexually active teens do not have a disrupted hymen. The hymen is often very flexible."</p><p>Gunter added that two thirds of women don't experience pain or bleed the first time they have sex and for those that do it is usually just spotting.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/NINTCHDBPICT000468829318.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-17-at-9.35.53-AM-e1592588979566.png><p>"The hymen does not have a rich blood supply," she added. "Blood stained sheets come from sexual trauma."</p><p>"The hymen means nothing physically and hymen exams are medically not a thing and are unnecessary," Gunter concluded, adding that these check-ups support "a disgusting patriarchal trope."</p><p>While fans blasted T.I.'s "weird and disgusting" statements online, <span>Deyjah's mom, Ms Niko, also addressed T.I. virginity comments in a thinly-veiled dig at her former partner.&nbsp;</span></p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">most read in entertainment</h2></p><p>After his Red Table interview, she wrote “…Whew Chile, the Narcissism…” on her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> Stories.</p><p>T.I. is also dad to Messiah, 19, and Domani, 18, with his ex, Lashon Dixon.</p><p>He shares Clifford ("King"), 15, Major, 11, and Heiress, 3, with Tiny and he is also stepdad to her 23-year-old daughter, Zonnique.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>The hymen is a left over collection of cells that typically partially occludes the vaginal opening. Many mammals have hymen.
