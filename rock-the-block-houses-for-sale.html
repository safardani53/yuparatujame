Sure, you might not be handy, but it's still pretty entertaining to watch someone else turn their home into the domicile of their dreams.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>And <a href=#>Rock the Block</a> has a who's who of pros from the network ready to transform beautiful spaces. Season 3 is about to roll out with a new collection of homes set in Charleston, S.C. But are the houses that they make for sale?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Yes, the 'Rock the Block' houses in the popular show are indeed for sale.</h2><p>Not only are they for sale, but some fans of the show have already bought them and moved their families inside. Like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gloria Tsang Winnick</a> who purchased one of the four Rock the Block projects in Pardee Homes' Aliento community, situated in Santa Clarita, Calif., shortly after Season 1.</p><p>Gloria was over the moon that Leanne Ford of Restored by the Fords had worked on the home she purchased: "We had a house in the West Adams area of Los Angeles, and it was a 100-year-old craftsman. We were always watching HGTV to get ideas about fixing your own house, and it’s just something that we really like to watch. … I’ve always really liked Leanne’s work, so when I realized she was doing that show, we watched it."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Gloria said that she didn't immediately recognize the area the home was located in. In fact, she had never even been up to Santa Clarita before seeing the house and falling in love with it. "It kind of looked like Palm Springs to me because of the topography," she said. "I’ve never been up to Santa Clarita, so I didn’t even know it really existed."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I fell in love with the house that Leanne was doing just because it’s very my aesthetic and very unique and original," she continued. Gloria decided to email HGTV to find out what the network was doing with the homes, which is how she discovered they were being put up for sale.</p><p>At the time, the Winnick family had zero intentions of selling their house, but they wanted to see the Rock the Block house for themselves.</p><p>"We ended up coming up and, of course, I fell in love with the house entirely — still not thinking there was any way I could ever buy it," she revealed. But after seeing the neighborhood that the house was situated in, she started imagining her 3-year-old son growing up there, and it just felt like the perfect fit.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Three months after speaking with her real estate agent and putting their home up for sale, the Winnicks were in contract for their dream home, which was a wonderful "compromise" for both Gloria and her husband. He had always wanted a newly built house, while she favored the charm of older homes.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In a way, they were able to have their cake and eat it, too. The house packed the OG aesthetic that Gloria loved, but with all modern renovations and updates that made her husband happy. To top it all off, it was in a community that they're excited about raising their young son in.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Other 'Rock the Block' houses have gone up for sale, too.</h2><p>Really, the trick to snagging one of these houses is to catch it when it goes on the market. In January, Jasmine Roth's winning $1.149 million house was listed for sale in Santa Clarita, Calif.</p><p>Jasmine's renovations raised the property's value to $1.02 million, leading to her having the highest-appraised house for the season.</p><p>While the house was being sold by The Agency's Ray Akbari, it no longer comes up on their website.</p><p>Each of these houses will probably be sold by different real estate companies as they become available, so you'll want to keep an eye on the market in the show's previous cities if you're looking to snag one.</p><p>Rock the Block airs on Mondays on HGTV at 9 p.m. EST.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfp7ykt4ytn55lkqG8pLeMoaauq5Woeqe70WaqmqSV</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./sasha-calle-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Photos Of The Actress Playing Supergirl  Hollywood Life">&larr;
