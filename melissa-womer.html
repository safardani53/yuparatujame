She is best known as the ex-wife of famous comedian Jim Carrey, with whom she has a daughter.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Early_Life></span>Early Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Melissa faced many difficulties as a child because she was born into a dysfunctional family</strong>. Being born into a dysfunctional family can pose a number of difficulties. Substance abuse, mental illness, and domestic violence are all examples of family dysfunction.</p><p>Children growing up in dysfunctional homes may have difficulty forming attachments, trust issues, and difficulty regulating their emotions. They may also struggle with educators that their family is “different” and feel isolated from their peers.</p><p>As they get older, they may continue to struggle with intimacy issues and have trouble forming healthy relationships.</p><p>Despite all of the difficulties and challenges she faced as a child, Melissa worked hard to establish a career and a good life for herself.</p><p>She continued her education at the University of Kansas before moving to Hollywood and establishing herself in the comedy world.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Melissa-Wom-1.webp alt="Jim Carrey's Ex-wife" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Relationship_With_Jim_Carrey></span>Relationship With Jim Carrey<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Melissa Womer drew public attention when she ran into struggling actor and comedian Jim Carrey at the Comedy Store at the time</strong>. They became close quickly and began dating in 1986. The following year, they married in a hotel in Santa Monica, California.</p><p>Jane Erin Carrey was born on September 6, 1987, just a few months after Carrey and Womer married. Their union didn’t last very long. Carrey and Womer divorced in the mid-1990s, with Carrey claiming that the breakup was due to their respective demanding occupations.</p><p>According to rumors, he divorced her so that they could date Hollywood diva Lauren Holly. And that led to the collapse of a once thriving marriage.</p><p>As part of the divorce settlement, Womer requested $5 to $10 million from Carrey. She only got $3.5 million, though. She received $7 million for her daughter Jane after they had been apart for eight years.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Relationship_With_Her_Daughter_Jane></span>Relationship With Her Daughter Jane<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Her daughter Jane gave birth to Alex Santana’s child, who is named Jackson Riley, making her a grandma</strong>. Santana is known to be the lead vocalist of the metal band Blood Money.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Melissa-Womer-1.jpg alt="Melissa Womer Height" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Currently Santana and Jane have been divorced and they both share joint custody of their child. That is the only information that Melissa Womer shares about her family. She chooses to keep her siblings and parents’ identities hidden because she was born into a dysfunctional family and worked hard to rise to the top.</p><p>Jim Carrey’s daughter, on the other hand, did not follow in her father’s footsteps and did not appear on the big screen. Instead she pursued her career as a singer.</p><p>She rose to fame in 2012 after participating in the singing competition “American Idol.” In addition to her work on Kidding and Catfish: The TV Show, Jane is a musician and performer.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Melissa_Womer_Height_Weight></span>Melissa Womer Height & Weight<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Womer, who is 62 years old, is stunning and has a well-defined body. She doesn’t exhibit any aging symptoms</strong>. Womer is 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighs 58 kg.</p><p>She is a medium-sized woman, with measurements of chest size, 36 inches, waist size, which is 25 inches, and hip size, 36 inches. The ex-wife of Jim Carrey still sports her beautiful blonde hair and gorgeous brown eyes.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Jim Carrey's Ex-wife</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Melissa Womer</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiknqSZqMCiedaopJ6qXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./nba-star-carmelo-anthony-announces-retirement-after-19-seasons.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="NBA Star Carmelo Anthony Announces His Retirement After 19 Seasons">&larr;
