Though she has more than 34 million subscribers on YouTube, her viewers are calling for her to apologize or step down following the controversy.</p><p>Throughout her time on the internet, Lia has avoided plenty of scandals, including reports of <a href=#>transphobic</a> comments and some with an alleged ex-husband.

Viewers would often comment on their relationship, inquiring how they came to be together.</p><p>In June 2023, Lia finally addressed the comments shading the relationship while confirming their split. In a quote tweet of a photo of the couple saying "I still don't know how he pulled her," Lia made it clear things with Evan were over.</p><p>"Well after nine years things didn't work out lol," she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a>.</p><p>Lia continued to pull no punches in the replies, clapping back at a follower who claimed to look like Evan "that's not a flex."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>It's not entirely clear what brought about the end of their relationship, as neither Lia nor Evan have addressed their split in the time since, but it's clear that whatever happened, they didn't end on particularly amicable terms. There have also been rumors of a lawsuit between the two parties, alleging that Evan curated and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">scripted</a> much of the reaction content on her channel, though those reports have not been confirmed.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does SSSniperWolf have an OnlyFans?</h2><p>Attractive women who make content online are often assumed to have an OnlyFans and sell NSFW content.
