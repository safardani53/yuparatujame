But people assume our life is different.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/09/nintchdbpict000351218292.jpg><p>Sophia, 28, retired from performing three years ago and now directs and produces adult movies with Danny for their company AHusseyxxx.</p><p>The pair make flicks for Brazzers and Digital Playground, two of the biggest porn distributors in the world.</p><p>Incredibly, she worked for DIY shop Jewson straight out of school and was spotted by a modelling agent on the high street in Dundee.</p><p>The blonde was snapped up by sex line TV show Babestation and did glamour modelling before turning X-rated.</p><p>It was on a porn set in Inverness five years ago that the lovebirds met.</p><p>Now the former actress admits they are a real power couple in the industry.</p><p>She says: “I didn’t grow up thinking I wanted to be a porn star but someone’s got to do it and I fell into it, everyone’s story is the same.</p><p>“Apart from Danny, he did leave school wanting to do that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/09/nintchdbpict000351009668.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN NEWS</h2></p><p>“I’m lucky I was naturally good at it, it didn’t faze me because I was quite outgoing.</p><p>“It felt normal to me and I’d found my place in life.</p><p>“Our company has been running for a year now and we’ve pushed it as hard as we can.</p><p>“Luckily we had a big following already so they jumped on it and we’re grateful for the support.</p><p>“I’ve been retired for three years now but Danny still performs, he does a lot of the scenes we produce and direct so it’s win-win for everyone.</p><p>“I only did girl-on-girl and there was only so much work out there.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/09/nintchdbpict000351218238.jpg><p>“It was time to take a back seat and watch Danny’s career take off.”</p><p>As Danny is one of the biggest porn stars in the world, he can usually be found romping with multiple women every week — and Sophia is behind the camera.</p><p>She says: “I’m not going to lie and say it didn’t faze me. We’re still human and it’s an emotional rollercoaster.</p><p>“It’s not natural to be in a relationship where someone has sex with other people or sex with other people in front of you.</p><p>“It’s not easy but you learn to deal with it because you love and trust each other and will always be together no matter what.</p><p>“In the beginning it was difficult but it’s just a job. At the end of the day, he leaves the girl on set and has no emotional connection to her, he’s not Danny D when he comes home.</p><p>“I am there when he’s performing but you become emotionally numb to it. I see it as him doing his job, I look at it differently than a normal person not in the industry.”</p><p>And she jokes: “He knows who is boss if he wants fed when he comes home.”</p><p>The couple travel to America and Europe to film their flicks.</p><p>But The Scottish Sun revealed on Wednesday that care agency boss Natalie Richards, 28, was horrified to discover she had unwittingly rented out her spare office space to him.</p><p>Danny claimed he only used the office in Maidstone, Kent, for storage but Ms Richards, who had sub-let the room, began eviction proceedings, fearing he would film porn there.</p><p>However, it’s in the US — where porn stars are celebs — that they really feel at home. But even in the UK they get stopped for selfies in their local supermarket.</p><p>Sophia admits: “It’s still quite a taboo subject here but in America you’re classed as minor celebrities, you’re recognised a lot.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/09/nintchdbpict000350489048.jpg><p>“Here it’s a mixed bag, people either know you and are happy they’ve met you or they stare at you.</p><p>“Danny is the celeb at the moment, he can go to Asda and get recognised.</p><p>“I hate going out with him because it happens so much. I don’t mind it at all but I’m the photographer, they don’t even look at me and just pass me the phone.</p><p>“It’s a mixed range of people asking for photos, older and younger people and couples.</p><p>“It is always nice when fans come up because you realise you’re doing well and they appreciate you.”</p><p>Some of their latest flicks include parodies like Power Bangers — their raunchy interpretation of superhero favourites Power Rangers.</p><p>The bio for the movie describes the plot as ‘five horny college students have their lives turned upside down when evil threatens Planet Earth.’</p><p>And Sophia has revealed its sexy stars didn’t want to get out of their colourful costumes.</p><p>She says: “We shot Power Bangers in Las Vegas and we’re really happy with how it came out.</p><p>“We also just finished shooting Fly Girls, we managed to get a private jet and a helicopter and spent five days shooting this really epic movie.”</p><p>Although they are stars thanks to their frisky romps, Sophia insists they have never hidden anything from their families.</p><p>And she says the couple — who would like to have kids — will never be ashamed to tell their children how their parents make money.</p><p>Sophia says: “Kids are very developed nowadays, they learn so quickly with their iPads and computers and we’d never keep it from them or lie about it.</p><p>“Everything that they’ll have is going to be because of porn.</p><p>“The house and nice cars are all because of what we do.</p><p>“It’s a great industry. If you love something, you’ll do it as long as possible.”</p><p>Danny jokes: “Technically they can just wheel me in so I can keep going until I’m 65.”</p><p><strong>We pay for your stories and videos!
