I can be all these things and it does not matter if I have boobs.&nbsp;</p><p>“There's nothing I can do about [them] so I might as well... I like them, so I might as well show them off. It makes me feel good.</p><p>“I can wear what I want. We need to grow and have an open mind on how a business woman or entrepreneur can look. You don't have to look a certain way.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="MORE SPORTS FEATURES">MORE SPORTS FEATURES</h2><p>So, as Paige vows to keep infuriating the trolls with her sexy get-ups, we revisit her most outrageous outfits from over the years.</p><h2>Cheeky flash</h2><p>Earlier this year, Paige took part in a charity golfing match against <a href=#>Jerry Kelly</a>, called Beauty vs. the Beast.</p><p>And Paige proved she looked the part, when she posed at the National Geneva Resort.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/paige-spiranac-855289897.jpg><p>She wore a white golfing shirt, and very short blue skirt, as well as a traditional golfing cap, and posed cheekily lifting up her skirt to flash a bit more flesh on Instagram.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Golf</h2></p><p>Along with the picture, she wrote: “Raised a ton of money with Jerry Kelly at Geneva National Resort.”</p><h2>Pretty in pink</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/paige-spiranac-855289974.jpg><p>Paige has said before how she prefers wearing leotards and spandex to play golf, as she thinks she performs better - which is why she most likely chose this teeny pink number to promote her golfing equipment.</p><p>Earlier this year, she told <a href=# aria-label="Sports Illustrated (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Sports Illustrated</a>: “I was so comfortable wearing spandex and very little of it because that’s just what you wear when you’re wearing a leotard and you’re competing.</p><p>"When I switched into golf, we were struggling a little bit financially and so I didn’t have the luxury to go out and buy a whole new golf-appropriate wardrobe.</p><p>"So I wore what was in my closet which was work-out clothes. That’s just how I learned to play the game."</p><h2>Gorgeous in green</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/paige-spiranac-805083845.jpg><p>Looking at Paige’s Instagram, it’s clear she’s a big fan of green, opting for the colour associated with golf very often.</p><p>And she cheekily put a sexy spin on the iconic green <a href=#>Masters</a> jacket to celebrate the start of the major championship, in April 2022.</p><p>Wearing a matching green skirt and jacket, with nothing underneath - so her cleavage was still on show - she wrote: "A tradition unlike any other. Who do you see winning this week?"&nbsp;</p><h2>Hallow-queen</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/paige-spiranac-happy-halloween-puddin-690267232.jpg><p>With Halloween coming up, it only seems fitting that one of Paige’s most risque outfits was a Harley Quinn costume.</p><p>To cosplay as the character made famous by fellow blonde bombshell Margot Robbie, she wore a leotard with ripped fishnets and her hair in bunches, while holding a golf club, of course.</p><p>She wrote: “Happy Halloween puddin from your Harley Quinn.”</p><h2>Street smart</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/paige-spiranac-855289971.jpg><p>Last year’s Halloween costume was just as skimpy for Paige, when she dressed as Cammy from Street Fighter.</p><p>She donned a green, high-cut leotard, a red beret and red fingerless gloves for the outfit, wearing her hair in plaits.</p><p>And she wrote: “For the @swaggolfco Halloween Costume Contest I’ve dressed as Cammy from Street Fighter🎃.</p><p>“ I love their Street Fighter series so this was a no brainer😏.”</p><h2>Net gains</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/paige-spiranac-855289877.jpg><p>It’s clearly not just golf that Paige is into, as she celebrated the start of March Madness - when the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) men's and women's college <a href=#>basketball</a> tournaments are held - &nbsp; in a very skimpy outfit.</p><p>Standing on a wet basketball court, holding a basketball, Paige was wearing a tiny red and white bra and hot pants, grinning, with her hair in a ponytail.</p><p>In one picture from behind, she showed off her very pert bum.</p><p>She wrote: “I don’t think this is what they meant by make it rain lol but rain or shine March madness starts today! Who do you have winning?”</p><h2>Touching base</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/paige-spiranac-855289892.jpg><p>Paige also is clearly fond of a bit of <a href=#>baseball</a>, as she celebrated the World Series starting last year, with a very sexy take on the traditional uniform.</p><p>The usual black and white pinstripe shirt and trousers, with red lining, had been turned into a crop top and hot pants.</p><p>Sharing the pictures, including one in which she cheekily showed off her bum, she wrote: “World Series starts tonight!⚾️&nbsp;</p><p>“Who do you have winning? The Astros or Phillies?”</p><h2>Star and stripes</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/paige-spiranac-829537262.jpg><p><a href=#>Tennis</a> is obviously another one of Paige’s many passions - as well as her home country of the United States.</p><p>Ahead of day two of the <a href=#>US Open</a> at The Country Club in Brookline, <a href=#>Massachusetts</a>, last year, Paige showed off her patriotism in a bikini emblazoned with the stars and stripes.</p><p>And, if that wasn't American enough, she wolfed down a platter of hot dogs too.</p><p>She wrote: "US Open day 2! Who do you think is going to win?</p><p>“My two picks aren't doing so bad so far."</p><h2>Jet setter</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/paige-spiranac-855289887.jpg><p>In a cheeky nod to <a href=#>Top Gun</a>, Paige dressed in a fighter jet outfit, but with a very sexy twist, to promote the energy drink, Jet Fuel.</p><p>Holding a helmet, emblazoned with the word “Bombshell,”, as she stood in front of a plane, Paige looked amazing in her very tight boiler suit, zipped down to show off her ample cleavage.</p><p>“Stunning Maverick,” one fan wrote, not missing the homage to <a href=#>Tom Cruise</a>.</p><h2>Paige turner</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/NINTCHDBPICT000791028602.jpg><p>While Paige doesn’t have an <a href=#>OnlyFans</a> account, she does have a subscription-based platform called OnlyPaige - knowing what her fans want.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Advertising her website, she wore a very small black crop top, showing off her cleavage, adding: “And this is just the never before seen pictures.</p><p>“Have golf tutorials, personalised videos, members perks, and so much more!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH91gZNxZ2xsX6WuqrPEZqqpoaKWu6Kv0maqnrCZmsC1ec6uq5%2BhpKh8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./pink-sings-while-celebrating-1st-night-of-hanukkah-with-her-family.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Pink Sings While Celebrating 1st Night of Hanukkah With Her Family">&larr;
