Talking about it, her exact date of birth of Erica is unknown.</p><p>But we know that she is 32 years old as she was born in 1991.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Erica-Sherman-Posing.jpg><p>Also, her height, weight, and other measurements are not currently available, and she is a beautiful woman with black skin.</p><p>We can also presume that she belongs to the African-American ethnicity. In addition to that, her hair and eye color are also black.</p><h3>Childhood & College Life</h3><p>According to her various interviews, she is a native of California. Erica’s birthplace is missing, but we could say she must have spent her early life there.</p><p>Sherman has kept her personal life away from the media; we cannot write anything about her childhood or school life.</p><p>But Erica has spoken that she moved out of California to another city to pursue her career just after her high school graduation.</p><p>In 2012, Erica completed her degree in Mass Communication and majored in Public Relations with a minor in Business Administration at Louisiana State University.</p><h2>Career&nbsp;</h2><p>After completing her bachelor’s studies, Erica worked as an intern for the St. Louis Rams for two months. The LSU graduate also interned for five years at Fox Sports from 2007 to 2012.</p><p>Likewise, Erica tried a few jobs, searching for her passion until she found what satisfied her soul.</p><p>She was an assistant to Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ Glazer Family Foundation in 2013 for two years.</p><h3>Major Career Achievement</h3><p>In 2015, Sherman returned home, but not alone.</p><p>When Los Angeles Rams were back in California, Erica joined them as their Community Affairs and Player Involvement manager.</p><p>However, her action led to making head news, and she was approached by different media for information and interviews.</p><p>Choosing L.A. Rams was wise for Erica, as she gained fame and love after joining the team. She monitored Ram’s Women’s Organization and worked as a liaison too.</p><p>Her management period continued for five years, till 2020, and she currently looks after her boyfriend’s business and career.</p><h3>Family</h3><p>We know Erica grew up with her sister, but unfortunately, we do not know her name.</p><p>In one of the vlogs of Donald’s Youtube channel, released on 28th July 2020, Donald was seen meeting jeweler Moe Diamonds where he explained how he wanted a special bracelet for his now wife Erica a week before her birthday.</p><p>In a birthday surprise video posted by Aaron, we can see Erica talking with her <a href=# rel=noopener>father</a> and sister, wishing her a birthday. Even so, their names and other details are not revealed yet.</p><p>Similarly, we cannot say anything about her mother and other family members.</p><p>The gorgeous couple stayed together when Erica and Aaron were engaged in Calabasas, California.</p><h2>Relationship</h2><p>Erica and Aaron likely met when Erica worked for the Rams during 2015-2020.</p><p>The information about the duration of the dating life of the pair is not public yet. In 2020, they were engaged.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Aaron-Donald-Girlfriend-Erica-Sherman.png><p>Aaron broke up with his long-time high school love, Jaelynn Blakely, around 2019. So, we can assume that the affair between Sherman and Donald has not gained momentum.</p><p>Despite the short-time love affair, Donald already proposed to Sherman. It is baffling what sparked between these two love birds in just a short time.</p><p>Donald is a father of two children, Jaelynn Donald and Aaron Donald Jr. These children were born when Aaron and Jaelynn were together.</p><p>They married between 2020 and 2021 and are happily married to date.</p><p><a href=#><strong>You can also read: All About Aaron Donald’s Daughter Jaeda</strong></a></p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>The information about Erica’s wealth and riches is not known. Still, taking a solid look at her enriched work history and experience gained in the field.</p><p>Hence, mentioning this much of her career success, we can assume that she is worth more than a million dollars.</p><p>Erica Sherman’s net worth is estimated at $2 million.</p><p>Aside from Sherman, Aaron’s estimated net worth is more than $60 million. He has collected this fortune playing as the highest-paid defensive player in the National Football League.</p><h2>Social Media Presence</h2><p>Erica is a media person; she is available on social media such as Instagram and Twitter, where she posts about her lifestyle.</p><p>Instagram (@ericadonald99): 34.5k followers</p><p>Twitter (@EriDon_99): 5877 followers</p><h2>Popularity Graph&nbsp;</h2><p>Erica Sherman, now known as Erica Donald, became famous after being in a relationship with renowned <a href=# rel=noopener>NFL</a> defensive Aaron Donald.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Erica-Sherman.jpg><p>The above graph shows Sherman’s popularity over the past twelve months.</p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQS)</h2><h3>How many kids does Erica Sherman have?</h3><p>Erica Sherman has no kids and is married to Aaron Donald.
