Back then, he was hosting at Husky Stadium for the UCLA game against Washington.</p><p>Of course, it was also when UCLA quarterback <a href=# rel=noopener>Josh Rosen</a> suffered an apparent left-hand injury. In addition, Huard had covered the scene stating if anything was going on with Josh and if the number one quarterback had a wrong turn.&nbsp;</p><p>Later, reporters had asked Jim Mora about those questioning Rosen’s ‘toughness.’ That was when Mora went on with his statement stating it wasn’t Huard’s opinion that was needed. Also, his statement would only bring up controversial ground.</p><p>“I think it’s ludicrous that anyone would question Josh Rosen’s toughness when they don’t know the nature of his injury. Maybe the producer was talking in his ear, I don’t know.”</p><p>“But it doesn’t make any sense to me that Brock Huard has any way to ever question Josh Rosen. But that’s his job, so I do understand that that’s his job.”</p><p>Indeed, Brock Huard also made his piece of statement afterward.</p><p>“He’s going to protect his team. He’s going to do whatever he can to protect his player. If that means taking some shots at me, that was in his prerogative to do so.”</p><h2>Brock Huard | Net Worth</h2><p>As of 2022, Brock Huard is estimated to have a net worth of $6 million.
