The passionate football player soon gained prominence, and the school immediately recognized him as a letterman.</p><p>Chubb primarily played in the defensive end position during his initial seasons, but the team management decided to move him to the outside linebacker position during his senior year.</p><p>After graduating high school, Chubb went to West Forest University, where he played college football for the Demon Deacons. He redshirted his first year.</p><p>Brandon had 88 tackles in his sophomore season, appearing in all 12 games. He received the ACC Top Six for Service award for his performance.</p><p>The following year, Chubb had his career-best season in which he played all 12 games and recorded 109 tackles. Brandon entered the senior season as the Decons’ senior defenseman with the most game starts.</p><h3>Professional Career</h3><p>Even though Brandon had a reputation for being one of the best Demon Deacons products, no NFL team showed interest in him. As a result, he went undrafted in the 2016 NFL Draft.</p><p>The Los Angeles Rams signed him as an undrafted free agent that same year. Over the following years, Brandon tried redeeming his professional career but was unsuccessful.</p><p>After his injury in 2017, the little chances he thought he had were also over. However, he was associated briefly with NFL teams such as Indianapolis Colts, Tennessee Titans, and Carolina Panthers until 2019.</p><h2>Bradley Chubb Brother | Brandon Off the Field</h2><p>Brandon Chubb is involved in different other fields of work outside football. Until the end of the second year of his college, he had thought that playing football was the only thing he wanted to do and nothing otherwise.</p><p>However, one fateful incident during his time at Wake Forest changed his thinking. He learned about an organization named Help Our People Eat, in short HOPE, and joined it as a volunteer.</p><p>As the name signifies, the organization’s main aim is to deliver food to hungry people with the help of its volunteers and financial contributors.&nbsp;</p><p>Although Brandon began contributing to them casually, he later became immersed in their tasks. At one point, he even thought about leaving football entirely and doing something that helps people in society.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Brandon-Chubb-Charity.jpg><p>Continuing that job, Brandon is now the CEO of the Chubb Foundation, which he and his brother founded to engage in community service programs. They have provided education, food, and mentorship to underprivileged people in society.</p><p>Furthermore, they conduct football training programs through football camps as well.</p><p>Aside from that, Chubb has been working as the player director at NFL Players Association (NFLPA) since 2021.</p><p>After his association with one of the oldest labor unions in the sports sector, he has been actively advising NFL players regarding various problems they face while dealing with stakeholders in the league.</p><p>In addition, he runs different other business companies, namely Captain Partners and Concrete Rose Capital, etc., among many others.</p><p><strong>Also Read About&nbsp;<a title="Aaron Boone Brother: Bret Boone’s MLB Career & Steroid Controversy" href=# rel="bookmark follow noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal>Aaron Boone Brother: Bret Boone’s MLB Career & Steroid Controversy</a></strong></p><h2>About Bradley Chubb</h2><p>As mentioned above, Bradley Chubb is a highly professional football player, unlike his older brother.
