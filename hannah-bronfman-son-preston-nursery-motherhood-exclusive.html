Wanting to enjoy some private time with their newborn, Bronfman didn't officially announce the arrival of her bundle of joy until December during <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>an interview</a> with former president <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Barack Obama</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now, as the new mom juggles finding the balance between work-from-home maternity leave and motherhood duties, Bronfman is kicking off 2021 by spending a lot of quality time with Preston in his neutral-themed nursery.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1><strong>RELATED GALLERY:</strong> See All of the Celebrity Babies Born in 2020</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We were really, really excited to make a nursery," Bronfman tells PEOPLE. "It's obviously something that goes along with having a kid, and I had always wondered with our house here what are we going to do? Or what is it going to look like?"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Going along with their modern farmhouse vibe, the new parents teamed up with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Crate and Kids</a> to create a dream nursery that reflected the "minimal aesthetic" of their Long Island, New York home.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We wanted our nursery to feel like it went perfectly with our house. And so, the vibe is very neutral, airy ... We have lots of neutral black and white tones throughout our house, and we really carried that over into the nursery."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Hannah Bronfman's nursery for baby Preston.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>David Land</span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Hannah Bronfman and Brendan Fallis.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>David Land</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She continues, "We were so excited to work with Crate and Kids. They had such a great offering of really sleek, modern furniture ... and honestly, they had a few key pieces that I really wanted to just work the nursery around."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ultimately, Bronfman and her husband "wanted to go for less of a kid scene, and more of just a chic space that we all felt really comfortable in."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PEOPLE's free daily newsletter</a> to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Noting one of her favorite pieces in the nursery, the mom highlighted the Crate and Kids' Leanne Ford Snoozer, a chic and cute ottoman that doubles as room storage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's perfect, because not only can you sit on it if you need it, but it's also storage. And then I put little clips on top with a little stuffed animal, and it's right next to the rocking chair that I use to breastfeed," she explains, before describing her love for the nursery's main attraction: the crib.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We actually didn't do co-sleeping. For naps, we'll do all together or him in our bed, but for nighttime sleep, we have him in his crib. He has been in his crib since the beginning. And now that he's almost eight weeks, we put a mobile over it and he just loves his crib," she says of the Black and Natural Thornhill Crib. "He's by no means sleep trained or anything like that, but he's starting to know that that's his place for his bedtime. I feel like when he goes to sleep there and wakes up there every morning, he starts to put in this sense of routine. And so, that's really nice."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>David Land</span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>David Land</span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>David Land</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to talking about her sophisticated nursery, Bronfman also details what it is like to be a first-time mom. Calling the experience of motherhood "an incredible new journey" the HBFIT founder and activist also shares "challenges" she has faced.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Everyone tells you what to expect. Like, 'You'll never love something more in your life' and you're like, 'Okay, I get it. I'm excited.' And then you have him, and you're like, 'Oh my God.' It's so true," she says. "It becomes a whole different thing. I mean, the early weeks definitely have presented their challenges and their learnings, but it's so rewarding. It's just a wild rollercoaster of emotions."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She continues, "I would say that for me, the most challenging part about [becoming a mom] I think was my time management. I don't think I gave myself the space — because I run my own business — I didn't really put this real emphasis on taking maternity leave."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But the little moments with her son have outweighed any kind of challenges.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I found it easy actually to really just be fully in the moment ... cozied up and not leaving your house, the days blend together because it just is you doing the same thing over and over again, but it's amazing. I think I was surprised by how easy I adapted to that lifestyle," Bronfman explains.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It has frustrating days but it's just an incredible new journey," she adds. "And at the end of the day, your baby does one cute thing, and you forget that he pooped on you five minutes ago."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6CWv6a606xmoZmeo66pecGrpqeenZa7br%2FOp2SpqpWowbC6jKesq6uVp8Zuuc6tn56qmKS8pXnEsZqlraOew6Z7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./nurse-drugged-patients-for-amusement-jailed-shocking-texts.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nurse Catherine Hudson &amp;amp; healthcare worker Charlotte Wilmot drugged patients for 'amusement' &amp;amp; boast">&larr;
