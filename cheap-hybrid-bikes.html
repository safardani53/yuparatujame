Where's the catch?</p><p>Sometimes, the price is the catch. But not when you know where to look for the best value hybrid bikes around.</p><p>Hybrid bikes work best for the commute as a combination of a road bike and mountain bike, ready to tackle whatever route you choose.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>They can handle both riding on the road and the slightly rougher terrain found on canal paths or bridleways, while the frame’s design leaves the rider in an upright position, making it a more comfortable ride than when hunched over on a road bike.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>You don’t have to spend a lot to get a good hybrid bike either. In fact, there is a great range of cheap models available that fall under the £500 mark.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Keep reading below to see our picks for the best ones on the market for under £500.</span></p><p><i>*If you click on a link in this story we may earn affiliate revenue.</i></p><h2>Riverside 500</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ezgif.com-webp-to-jpg-13-1-e1594032626826.jpg><ul><li><strong>Riverside 500 hybrid bike, £349.99 from Decathlon – <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Although the Riverside 500 might be twice the price of some of the hybrid bikes you might have seen elsewhere (such as Halford’s Apollo brand), it’s the cheapest one that we’d recommend. Pay any less and you might end up with a bike that you’ll outgrow very quickly – as they say, buy cheap, buy twice.</p><p>This shouldn’t be an issue with the Riverside 500, which Decathlon claims has been developed for regular rides of up to 30-plus miles.</p><p>When just starting out in cycling, the main thing to look for is being comfortable on the bike, and this is the Riverside 500’s focus. A suspension fork offers 60mm of travel (meaning it will smooth out most potholes and bumps in the road), while two of the main contact points between you and your bike (the saddle and handlebar grips) are ergonomically optimised.</p><p>Other highlights are a low-maintenance 9-speed gearing, mechanical disc brakes and an all-important bell.</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><h2>Carrera Crossfire 2</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ezgif.com-webp-to-jpg-14-1-e1594032756145.jpg><ul><li><strong>Carrera Crossfire 2 hybrid bike, £370 from Halfords – <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Hybrid bikes are something of a middle-ground between road bikes and mountain bikes, but some lean more heavily on one over the other.</p><p>The Halford-exclusive brand Carrera’s Crossfire line is clearly in the mountain bike camp, thanks to big chunky wheels, front suspension and relaxed frame geometry. This makes it perfect for those whose riding doesn’t stop when the asphalt ends, with it at home on the UK’s numerous networks of canal paths and gravel bridleways.</p><p>The Crossfire 2 is the middle point in the range. It’s a big step up from the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Crossfire 1</a> considering it’s only £50 more expensive – you get disc instead of V brakes, greater travel in the suspension fork, bigger wheels, three more gears – and is a great purchase if you can’t quite stretch to the £400 <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Crossfire 3</a>.</p><p>It’s also available in a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">women-specific version</a> with a lowered crossbar.</p><h2>Carrera Subway 2</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ezgif.com-webp-to-jpg-15-e1594032886199.jpg><ul><li><strong>Carrera Subway 2 hybrid bike, £375 from Halfords – <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>If the Crossfire above is Carrera’s ‘mountain bike’ hybrid bike, then the Subway is definitely its road-leaning cousin.</p><p>A solid entry-level bike for commuting, you’ll soon make your money back on your investment if used instead of driving or public transport.</p><p>The bike’s base – an aluminium frame and a rigid steel fork – is on the budget end of the scale, but the components used more than make up for it.</p><p>An 18-speed gearing that uses a smattering of Shimano products will provide enough range on the flats and the hills, while hydraulic disc brakes are a real rarity at this price point.</p><p>Elsewhere, chunky Kenda tyres help to smooth out your ride and include added puncture protection to reduce unplanned mid-ride stops.</p><p>It’s also a bike for the whole family, with there a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">junior version</a> too.</p><h2>B'Twin Hoprider 500</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/hybrid3-e1550496012393.jpg><ul><li><strong>B'Twin Hoprider 500 Urban Hybrid Bike, £399 from 99Spokes - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p class=p1><span class=s1>The Hoprider line by 99Spoke's B’Twin is a great introduction to hybrid bikes, and the mid-range 500 model manages to offer up great componentry for a relatively low price.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>A mountain bike-inspired suspension fork helps to smooth out rough roads and dirt paths, while its 24-speed gearing should help you get up even the steepest hill.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>It’s the included extras that make the Hoprider 500 stand out though. Mudguards and a double pannier rack come as standard, and a dynamo-powered front light means you’ll always be seen. It’s also available in a women-specific step-through build.</span></p><h2>Triban RC120 flat bar</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ezgif.com-webp-to-jpg-16-e1594033018398.jpg><ul><li><strong>Triban RC120 flat bar hybrid bike, £499.99 from Decathlon – <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Triban might be Decathlon’s in-house road cycling brand but it also has some cleverly converted hybrids in its stable. By switching out dropped handlebars for flat handlebars on a number of its models, its hybrids manage to remain lightning fast but come with a more upright riding position.</p><p>On the surface (aluminium frame, carbon fork, mechanical disc brakes), the RC120 belies its sub-£500 price tag.</p><p>A 16-speed Shimano gearset, tubeless ready-wheels and pannier mounts make it something you can progress with too – going from the start of your cycling journey through to commuting or touring.</p><h2>Trek FX 2</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/trek-fx-2-disc-2020-hybrid-bike-grey-EV364591-7000-1.jpg><ul><li><strong>Trek FX 2 2020 Hybrid Bike, £515 from Trek Bikes - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p class=p1><span class=s1>If you’re looking for a faster way to commute to work, then the lightweight FX 2 by Trek could be the bike for you.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The aluminium frame and componentry helps the bike’s total weight come in at a fraction over 11kg (for the large model), ensuring a speedy ride, even if going uphill.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The Shimano gearing is a slightly wider range than the one found on the B’Twin bike listed above, and its 24 gears give you enough options for most pursuits.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>New for the 2020 model is the inclusion of Tektro road-focused hydraulic disc brakes and some snazzy colour schemes – the ‘gravel’ grey being a particular highlight.</span></p><h2>Specialized Crosstrail</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/hybrid5.jpg><ul><li><strong>Specialized Crosstrail 2020, £750 from Balfes Bikes - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p class=p1><span class=s1>The Crosstrail by American brand Specialized just about scrapes under the £500 barrier, and manages to combine a lot of the best bits from other bikes on this list.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>A lightweight and robust aluminium frame is paired with a suspension fork, mechanical disc brakes and 38mm wide tyres to create a comfortable package that can tackle most surfaces.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Available in a subtle grey or eye-catching red, the Crosstrail is sure to turn heads wherever you take it.</span></p><h2>Boardman MTX 8.6</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ezgif.com-webp-to-jpg-17.jpg><ul><li><strong>Boardman MTX 8.6 hybrid bike, £575 from Halfords – <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Chris Boardman’s bike brand is available exclusively from Halfords and is something of a step up from the other manufacturers (Apollo, Carrera) stocked by the retail giant.</p><p>The MTX 8.6 is the entry-level offering in the brand’s more off-road-leaning hybrid line (the HYB range being more road-focused).</p><p>That said, there’s nothing entry-level about it. A lightweight aluminium frame and suspension fork with 63mm travel make for a comfortable ride whatever the terrain. It’s also possible to lock out the latter, turning it into a rigid fork perfect for road riding.</p><p>A variety of Shimano product lines are used for the 27-speed gearing, while its range of gears makes it a bike that will be fast on the tarmac and able to get up some steep off-road inclines.</p><p>As seen on the other bikes above that push the limit of a cheap hybrid bike, hydraulic disc brakes are included, and a set of 37c Schwalbe Tyrago tyres that feature Kevlar (the same material used in bulletproof jackets) will help you stay gripped and protected, whatever the terrain.</p><h2 class=p2><span class=s1>What is the best hybrid bike for under £500?</span></h2><p class=p1><span class=s1>While the answer to this question really depends on what you’re planning on using a hybrid bike for – with some suited to, say, commuting more than others – the best you can currently buy for £500 on the dot is the VooDoo Agwe.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Read on below to see why we think it’s the best cheap hybrid bike on the market.</span></p><h2 class=p2><span class=s1>Should I buy a road bike or a hybrid?</span></h2><p class=p1><span class=s1>If you’re new to cycling or are just after a bike for recreational riding, then a hybrid bike might be the way to go.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Although road bikes are often seen as the de facto choice for road-based riding, a hybrid can generally hold its own when commuting or in a city-centre location, while their upright position can actually make for a more comfortable experience over longer rides.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Add in the ability to handle rougher stuff too, and hybrid bikes become something of a do-it-all choice.</span></p><h2 class=p2><span class=s1><b>Are hybrid bikes worth the money?</b></span></h2><p class=p1><span class=s1>A hybrid bike can actually be a very cost-effective way of getting a bike with high-specification components for a fraction of the cost of a road or out-and-out mountain bike.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Even if you’re looking for a cheap hybrid bike under £500, you’re still likely to get a bike from a reputable brand that includes disc brakes and components from the likes of Shimano.</span></p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MORE FROM SUN SELECTS HEALTH AND FITNESS</h2></p><p>Enjoyed our round-up of the best value and cheapest hybrid bikes?
