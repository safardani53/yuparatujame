This could have happened on a night out.</p><p>"I feel really sorry for Miss Tweedie, I had already handed in my leavers form."</p><p>The student also asked the panel when he would get to "raise his feelings about what happened" as it was "not an issue he wanted to raise".</p><p>"It was an issue that people wanted to raise for me," he added.</p><p>"I have never been asked how I feel about it."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>The pupil revealed how he had consumed around three or four pints, a bottle of wine, some spirits, rum and shots before having sex with Miss Tweedie, who worked at Gleniffer High School in Paisley, Renfrewshire.</p><p>He claims the teacher, who now lives in Dubai and works as a yoga teacher, stayed the night in the room before leaving around 8am the following day.</p><p>Speaking at the GTCS hearing, Pupil A said: "We had no dealings prior to the prom. There were no relations before.</p><p>"Miss Tweedie was sat at our table. Miss Tweedie was not drinking at the table, I was."</p><p>After the prom, students had booked rooms in a Premier Inn that was within walking distance from SWG3.</p><p>Pupil A said: "I did not invite Miss Tweedie to the hotel. I don’t know how she got there."</p><p>He said he entered a hotel room where he found nine pupils and Miss Tweedie.</p><h2>'CAN WE ACT LIKE I'M NOT A TEACHER?'</h2><p>After a noise complaint, Pupil A said: "Me and Miss Tweedie were the only two left in the room.&nbsp;We kissed, no one initiated it.</p><p>"We went downstairs and had sex in my room. She stayed the night and we both left at eight."</p><p>Miss Tweedie, who was not present at the hearing, is alleged to have drunk shots before telling pupils: "Can we for a minute act like I’m not a teacher?"</p><p>Heather Prentice, Deputy Head of Gleniffer High School, told the court she had "concerns" about the teacher "regarding her outfit" as well as seeing her and Pupil A taking shots at the bar.</p><p>The 60-year-old said: "I do remember it was quite loose, short, low cut.</p><p>"I do remember that she looked like she was going on a night out."</p><p>And she said that she had warned the teacher, adding: "I wanted her to recognise that the pupils were getting a bit titillated by it."</p><p>She also claimed that she had seen Miss Tweedie on the phone saying "love, love" and blowing kisses, although she was unsure who she was speaking to.</p><p>Miss Tweedie faces being struck off the register by the General Teaching Council for Scotland (GTCS) following the allegations.</p><h2>STRING OF ALLEGATIONS</h2><p>These read: "Between 7 June 2017 and 8 June 2017, whilst employed by Renfrewshire Council as a PE Teacher at Gleniffer High School, at the senior prom and immediately thereafter, you danced inappropriately with pupils during the prom, including making inappropriate physical contact whilst dancing with them at SWG3, Glasgow.</p><p>"[You] kissed Pupil A at the hotel in which pupils were staying for the night, the Premier Inn Hotel and engaged in sexual intercourse with Pupil A after the prom, at the Premier Inn.</p><p>"[You] drank a shot (or shots) at the bar of SWG3, behaved in an inappropriate manner in a hotel room at the Premier Inn by drinking alcohol in the presence of pupils and stating words to the effect of 'Can we for a minute act like I’m not a teacher' to a pupil(s)."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Read more on The Sun</h2></p><p>Further allegations state the teacher "was alone on a bed with Pupil A and, when Pupil E entered the room, stated to Pupil E words to the effect of: “Technically I haven’t touched him yet.</p><p>"[You] were under the influence of alcohol to the point of being inebriated in the presence of pupils in the Premier Inn [and] had awareness that an ex pupil was in possession of drugs and did not report this to the appropriate authorities."</p><p>Tweedie is also alleged to have told the headteacher at the school that she was at home when she was at the Premier Inn.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Police Scotland were alerted to the incident and investigated it at the time but officers found no criminality had taken place.</p><p>The hearing continues.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/NINTCHDBPICT000710091280.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/NINTCHDBPICT000710091292.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZoR2hI9pbmtno6nCpbHNrWSsnahiwaatwqGcq2Wgp7yuecWenKWrXai8s77YZqCnrpWowaqzwK2gqKZf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./beauty-awards-2022-best-hair-and-makeup-products.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Best Hair and Makeup Products of 2022">&larr;
