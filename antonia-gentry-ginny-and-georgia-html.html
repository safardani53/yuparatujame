Playing the lead in the Netflix series remains the first big role&nbsp;— 23-year-old Gentry has ever undertaken. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Gentry Has Always Been Into Acting</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Gentry&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">made</a> her stage debut with a play written by her mother, Sandra, which she performed at their community theatre.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>In her&nbsp;Teen Vogue&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a> on February 24, 2021, the Atlanta native confessed that she'd dreamt of becoming an actor since she was five. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In the same interview, the actress&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">revealed</a> that as a child she&nbsp;used to make videos on her father’s video camera and&nbsp;pretend to be different&nbsp;characters. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>Two years ago, her mom accidentally stumbled upon one such video, where Gentry expressed her desire to be an actress.&nbsp;</p><p>I actually have videos that I used to make on my dad’s potato of a video camera… in one of [them] I actually say to the camera, ‘I think I’m going to become an actress.’ My mom found those videos about two years ago. It was so embarrassing but very cool to see.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>After realizing her love for acting, Gentry attended a fine-arts school and performed&nbsp;several plays at the regional, state, and national levels.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>After finishing high school, the actress decided to&nbsp;further work on her acting career, leading her to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">attend</a> the Emory University of drama. A year before her graduation, in 2018, the actress landed her debut on Netflix with a small part in the film&nbsp;Candy Jar. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>In the midst&nbsp;of her graduation process, the actor tried her luck for the lead role of Virginia Miller, a.k.a. Ginny, in the <a href=# rel=follow>Netflix</a> coming-of-age series Ginny and Georgia.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Reminiscing about the tough times she faced during her last year at university with final essays, exams, and the lead role, the actress expressed gratitude towards her professors for understanding and encouraging her. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>My professors were understanding and encouraging for the most part, but it was pretty hard bouncing back and forth between being a full-time college student, working part-time, and also trying to pursue this career.</p><p>Hard work always pays off, and so was the case for Gentry as well. Two weeks after her graduation, the actress was officially booked for Ginny and Georgia.</p><h2><span>Gentry Didn't Want To Lose The Role</span></h2><p><span>In her Teen Vogue interview, the actress </span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><span>admitted</span></a><span> that after getting booked for the role&nbsp;she had to do a lot of traveling for the chemistry read, which took her to different places from LA to Canada.</span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p><span>Because of all the traveling, Gentry developed blood clots in her leg, but she dealt with it in secret, as the role was very important to her.</span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p><span>That was kind of scary, but I [had] booked the role, and I wasn't going to tell anyone about my blood clot. I was like, this is too important. I'm just going to deal with it.</span></p><p><span>In her&nbsp;interview for Seventeen, the young actress </span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><span>mentioned</span></a><span>&nbsp;how the&nbsp;first thought that ran across her head when she got the role was, “make sure they don’t fire you."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Since it was her first time in such a big role, the actress confessed that she wanted everyone on set to like her, and although she was playing the lead character in the series, she was constantly&nbsp;growing.</span></p><h2>The Things 'Ginny' And 'Gentry' Have in Common</h2><p>In&nbsp;multiple interviews, the actress has&nbsp;mentioned how she relates&nbsp;to her character Ginny. In her interview with Teen Vogue, the actress&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>;&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Very rarely do you come across scripts [with] characters that you can totally relate with. I felt like Ginny was finally that.</p><p>In an interview with Seventeen on March 7, 2021, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Gentry expressed</a> that to re-live her teen years through Ginny allowed her to go back to the memories and the experiences she faced&nbsp;as a bi-racial person.&nbsp;</p><p>She mentioned being called by the scriptwriter, Sarah Lampart, as soon as they started filming. Gentry stated that Lampart invited her to share her experiences of growing up bi-racial and being in a predominantly white school - and having&nbsp;white friends.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Gentry mentioned how understanding Lampart was on her&nbsp;quest to tell an accurate story that everyone could relate to.&nbsp;</p><p>Having shared all her stories with Lampart, which helped build the script, the actress mentioned she felt like she finally has a voice, and the fact that it was a Netflix show, psyched her. Talking more about her&nbsp;experience, the actress stated: <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Because as you grow up, you're already marginalized and you're thinking that you don't have a voice that people really want to pay attention to, especially the biracial experience. So having that platform really, really helped me go into it feeling competent and it was very cathartic.</p><p>The actress confessed that some of the lines from the show said to Ginny by other characters were actually quoted&nbsp;from Gentry’s real-life conversations.</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The Differences</h2><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Gentry mentioned</a> that the major difference between her on-screen character and reality was that while Ginny had a white mother, her mother was colored and from Jamaica.&nbsp;</p><p>She also mentioned that her mom was her best friend and always understood her struggles, especially related to race. Unfortunately, Ginny lacked&nbsp;that. According to the actress, this&nbsp;allowed her to get her head around multi-racial communities' different experiences.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Another major factor that distinguishes Gentry from her on-screen character is her love life.</p><p>While Ginny is in a constant struggle between two men, Gentry seems to have a pretty solid love life with her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">long-time boyfriend</a>, Ezra Pounds.&nbsp;</p><p>Her boyfriend is bi-racial like her, with a Korean father. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The couple has been with each other for more than five&nbsp;years now. A&nbsp;post from Gentry’s Instagram on February 15, 2019, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">contained</a> a series of pictures of them holding hands.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Hounded By Swifties&nbsp;</h2><p>Despite all the glamour, fame has its downsides as well. In an&nbsp;interview with Elle, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Gentry&nbsp;expressed </a>that she knew what she was in for and&nbsp;was ready for it.</p><p>Recently, the young actress caught a feud with Taylor Swift fans (Swifties) when her character Ginny blurted a line to Georgia&nbsp;(Brianne Howey) in a fit&nbsp;of adolescent anger. After seeing Georgia change multiple partners, Virginia,&nbsp;the character played by Gentry, accused&nbsp;her of "going through men faster than Taylor Swift." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Quickly, the swifties came at Gentry with racist comments all over the social media.</p><p>The actress dealt with the situation quite diplomatically.&nbsp;She posted a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">thank you note</a> to her fans on her Instagram on March 4, 2021, instead of addressing the controversy directly.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>&nbsp;(Source:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.instagram.com/_antoniagentry_/</a>)&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></p><p>In her long post, the actress points out that she was very grateful for the love her fans have been showering her with love. Alongside, she mentions that she is grateful for the appreciation received from young girls who relate to her and feel heard while watching her character.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>She further adds that she loves Ginny, as she is flawed and imperfect, just like all of us. The actress wrote that her character is just a normal girl who is open to making mistakes is and entitled to her biases, prejudice, and injustices.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGiYnKyfp8Bwrc2tpqehkWK0prrTq7Bmn5mju7p5wKebZp%2BVpL%2BotcBnn62lnA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-to-watch-saints-games-live-2023-nfl-on-cbs-schedule.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How To Watch Saints Games Live">&larr;
