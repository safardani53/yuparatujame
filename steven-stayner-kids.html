In 1972, 7-year-old Steven Stayner went to school and never came home. He had been abducted in plain sight. But seven years later, he returned home to his family.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Not only was it a miracle, but during his escape, he had also rescued another 5-year-old boy who had been kidnapped. The media framed Steven as a hero. In fact, he became the subject of the two-part television movie I Know My First Name Is Steven, which aired in 1989.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>His family was happy to have him back, but things were different. Steven had become a famous figure, and not everyone liked all the attention he was getting.</p><p>Regardless, he went on to start a family, and while he probably wanted nothing more than to live a quiet life with his kids outside the spotlight, the Stayner family story was far from over. But before we get into that, let’s get to know Steven’s two kids: Ashley and Steven Stayner Jr., who are both featured in the documentary.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Steven Stayner got married to Jody Edmondson in 1985.</h2><p>Adjusting to post-abduction life was no easy task for Steven. He was raising hell at school and causing trouble with the law — but things started to change when he met Jody Edmondson. He fell in love. They dated for a year and got married in June 1985.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>In their four years together, they welcomed daughter Ashley, followed by son Steven Jr.</p><p>But adding children to the equation seemed to only make their relationship worse. The couple became estranged — albeit, they were actively trying to fix things. However, they ran out of time. Steven unexpectedly died in a motorcycle crash in 1989 when he was 24 years old.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Steven Stayner's kids were very young when their father died.</h2><p>When Steven passed away, Ashley was 3 years old and Steven Jr. was 2 years old. They had very few memories of their father and learned about his life the way most people did: through the media.</p><p>A decade after their father passed, four women were brutally murdered in nearby Yosemite. In Captive Audience, Ashley, who was a teen at the time, recalls following this news story very closely. However, little did she know that her uncle was the murderer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Steven's brother, Cary Stayner, confessed to the brutal murders — which ultimately brought the Stayner family back into the spotlight. Naturally, the media began analyzing the connection between abducted child Steven Stayner and his serial killer brother, Cary Stayner.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where are Ashley and Steven Jr. Stayner now?</h2><p>According to her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook page</a>, Ashley currently lives in Atwater, Cali. She previously attended a military university and served in the U.S. Air Force from 2007 to 2011.</p><p>In 2014, she shared the tragic news that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her partner</a> had passed away. Today, Ashley is a mom to a young daughter.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Furthermore, according to Steven Jr.'s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook page</a>, he currently resides in Merced, Cali. He is married with children (see his son above), and he also appears to have previously served in the U.S. Army like his sister.</p><p>See what Ashley and Steven Jr. Stayner have to say about their father and uncle in Captive Audience, which is now streaming on Hulu.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqMGmwsSnZKyska67pr6MpKCdqw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./dominic-sherwood-who-is-the-hottie-in-taylor-swifts-new-video.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is the Hottie in Taylor Swift's New Video?">&larr;
