During his sentence, prosecutors said that Paschel should be classed as a Range-II Offender owing to prior drug offenses and evidence from Wilson and his ex-wife that he had physically harmed them.</p><p>According to US Weekly, Paschel was found guilty of various offenses coming from an incident on June 9, 2019, with his ex-fiancÃ©e Kristen Wilson.&nbsp;Wilson informed Knox County Sheriffâ€™s Office officers that Paschel had assaulted her, grabbed her neck, and repeatedly slammed her head against a wall. Wilson said to police that Paschel had thrown her body to the floor and dragged her over it.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Geoffrey-Paschel-3.jpg alt="Geoffrey Paschel" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Geoffrey Paschel was sentenced to 18 years in prison.</h2><p>Officers noticed Wilson had bruises on her forehead, back, arms, and lips after the incident, and she was subsequently diagnosed with a concussion.&nbsp;Wilson informed investigators that Paschel refused to give her her phone and refused to allow her to leave the home during the incident. She was able to escape after he went to sleep, and she used a neighborâ€™s phone to alert the police.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Geoffrey Paschel sentenced to 18 years ðŸ‘€<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#GeoffreyPaschel</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/zkoo8jRDmr</a></p><p>â€” Nikki P- the GOOD NikkiðŸ™‚ðŸŒ¸ðŸ’œ (@missnikkip88) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">February 3, 2022</a></p><p>During Paschelâ€™s criminal trial in Knox County Criminal Court in October, the District Attorney Generalâ€™s Office told WBIR that Paschel told them that Wilson harmed herself. The hearing, according to officials, finished two days later.&nbsp;Paschel asked people to bring his children to Wilsonâ€™s home in a videotape revealed during the trial in order to convince her to petition the court to be kind toward him while he was in prison.</p><h2>A look back at Geoffrey Paschelâ€™s life.</h2><p>Geoffrey Paschel is a Knoxville, Tennessee resident who was born in 1978.
