In My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Mandylor played Nick Portokalos, a character he reprised in two sequels, My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 and My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3.</p><p>He has been active in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">entertainment industry</a> since the 1990s, yet there is little to no information about his personal life. He has never talked about getting married, having a wife and kids.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>However, it is reported that he is currently married to his wife, Kristina Petrova.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Louis Mandylor, his wife, and kids</h2><p>It is reported that Mandylor has been married to Petrova for a long time. It is unknown when the two when they met, began dating, and tied the knot.</p><p>However, several tabloids have mentioned that they dated for a couple of years before their marriage. Similarly, their wedding ceremony was small and private, with only friends and followers of the couple attending their nuptial.</p><p>Mandylor has never mentioned his wife, nor has posted about her on his social media. Since he has kept his personal life private, there is no information about their kids.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>It is unknown if they have any children. Many sources have reported that the couple does not have any kids.</p><p>However, on Facebook, Mandylor hinted that he might have a baby. On May 11, 2023, he posted a photo on the platform.</p><p>In the comments, one netizen wrote, “Great pic Luis keep up all the movies & congrads [sic] on baby!” While the actor did not reply to the comment, he liked it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-16-at-16.25.06.png><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">It looks like Louis Mandylor has a child with his wife. (Source: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Facebook</a>)</p><p>This might be a hint that he has a child, or two, with his wife. That being said, unless Mandylor confirms it, nothing can be said for sure.</p><p>This is basically all we know about the actor’s relationship, marriage, and kids. There have been no rumors of his split with Petrova, so it can be speculated that they are still together.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Louis Mandylor’s former marriages</h2><p>Mandylor was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">married</a> two times before his current relationship with Petrova. But just like his current marriage, the previous ones were also kept notoriously private.</p><p>It is reported that his first wife was Talisa Soto. Soto, born on March 27, 1967, is a former actress and model from the United States.&nbsp;</p><p>She is most recognized for her roles as Bond girl Lupe Lamora in the 1989 James Bond film Licence to Kill and Kitana in Mortal Kombat and its 1997 sequel Mortal Kombat Annihilation.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Soto formerly worked as a model, appearing in magazines such as Mademoiselle, Glamour, and Elle. It is unknown when Soto met Mandylor and when they got married.</p><p>Similarly, there is no information about their split and divorce. However, after her marriage ended with Mandylor, Soto married his brother, Costas, in 1997.</p><p>Unfortunately, their marriage ended in divorce in 2000. After Costas, Soto began dating actor Benjamin Bratt, and they married on April 13, 2002, in San Francisco.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>They had met eight years before at a casting audition. They began to form a romantic relationship while filming Piero (2001). Their first child, daughter Sophia Rosalinda Bratt, was born on December 6, 2002, and their second child, boy Mateo Bravery Bratt, was born on October 3, 2005.</p><p>Mandylor’s second wife was also an actress named Anila Zaman. She was 12 years younger than Mandylor but it seems like the duo did not mind their age gap.</p><p>Like his marriage with Soto, there is no information about when the actor met Zaman or when the duo tied the knot. However, it seems like they were together in the 2000s.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>This is because Mandylor took Zaman as his date for the premiere of My Big Fat Greek Wedding in April 2002. The couple were <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">photographed</a> at the Hollywood premiere of the movie at ArcLight Theatre in Hollywood, California, United States.&nbsp;</p><p>There is no information about Mandylor’s split and divorce from his second wife.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Louis Mandylor’s movies, TV shows, and net worth</h2><p>Mandylor, the son of Greek immigrants, was born on September 13, 1966, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. He and his brother chose a shortened version of their mother’s surname since their paternal surname was too lengthy.</p><p>Before entering the entertainment industry, Mandylor used to be an athlete.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>As a soccer player, he was a member of Heidelberg United FC (Megas Alexandros)’s State League title team in 1988. In 1989, he appeared in five National League games and scored one goal.</p><p>During his football career, he also boxed in Melbourne, winning 14 fights and losing four. He then moved to the United States to seek a boxing career, which was followed by an acting career.</p><p>As said before, he is best known for his portrayal of Nick Portokalos in the My Big Fat Greek Wedding franchise. Other than this, he has been a part of hundreds of movies and TV shows.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>He appeared as a guest on Relic Hunter alongside Tia Carrere. He co-starred with Sammo Hung in the first season of Martial Law as Louis Malone.&nbsp;</p><p>Mandylor featured as Joey’s twin in ‘The One With Unagi’ on the sitcom Friends. He was also featured on CSI: Miami twice, once as a robber/killer in the third season (2004) and once as a different character in the eighth season (2009).</p><p>He and his brother Costas appeared together in the Charmed episode “Saving Private Leo” (2002), the crime drama Sinners and Saints (2010), and My Brother Cicero (1998), a short film written and produced by Mandylor.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>The actor played the role of Deputy Lloyd in the Syfy thriller film The Cursed, which he co-stars in with his brother Costas. One of his most well-known characters was Bobby DeLuca in the 2001 film Suckers, in which he played a good guy turned car salesperson.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IMDb</a>, he has over 141 acting credits in movies and TV shows under his belt. Moreover, 12 of his future movies and TV shows are either in production or post-production.</p><p>To date, Mandylor has amassed a massive net worth. It is estimated that he has a net worth of $5 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6yfnl6YvK57wJyrqKpfoby2tdJmpJqmlK65sL6MsKCfnV2gtqW%2FjJyYq52Vp3w%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./water-tiktok-trend-weight-loss-clear-skin-dangers.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Warning over 'harmful' new trend promising rapid weight loss and clear skin">&larr;
