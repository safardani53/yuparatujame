I have never been into my hair and make-up. It didn’t appeal to me. Then, about three weeks later, mum said, ‘You have a dentist appointment, I’m picking you up from school early’. We went past the dentist. I said, ‘Where are we going?’</p><p>She said, ‘We’re going to the Manchester Model Agency’. I was in my school uniform, sat there fuming, with a face on. They signed me.”</p><p>She soon auditioned for <a href=#>Channel 4</a> soap <a href=#>Hollyoaks</a>, landing the role of “grumpy schoolgirl” <a href=#>Lisa Hunter</a> on her way to becoming a Power Woman of the Noughties.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on Ronaldo">Read More on Ronaldo</h2><p>She was on the show for four years, going from moody teen to sultry adult temptress.</p><p>Engaged to dancer <a href=#>Gorka Marquez</a>, 31, after meeting on <a href=#>Strictly Come Dancing</a> in 2017, they welcomed <a href=#>daughter Mia</a> in July 2019.</p><p>Before that, Gemma was engaged to former Brentford and Everton footballer <a href=#>Marcus Bent</a> in 2008; and, in 2013, <a href=#>Liam Richards</a>, who was a semi-finalist on <a href=#>Britain’s Got Talent</a> as part of martial-arts duo Strike.</p><p>But her most famous ex is footie superstar <a href=#>Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, whom she dated in 2007 during his first stint with <a href=#>Manchester United.</a></p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><h3>‘My life changed with one phone call’</h3><p>Despite his global fame, they once shared a very laid-back night in. Gemma recalled: “We went to my house, drank cups of tea and watched Only Fools And Horses. Genuinely! I don’t know if he’s into it now but he seemed to enjoy it.”</p><p>Loyal Gemma later turned down offers of piles of cash for a kiss-and-tell story. She said: “<a href=#>When we did split up</a>, I got offered so much money to speak about him. And I didn’t want that.”</p><p>It hasn’t all been fun times in the spotlight for Gemma. Recalling the heartbreak of losing her <a href=#>father David</a> at the age of 17, she said: “My life changed with one phone call.</p><p>“I still remember Mum coming into my room in the middle of the night to tell me Dad had died. He’d had a heart attack.”</p><p>Sharing her grief with fans recently, Gemma said: “Grief sucks. It’s difficult and different for everyone but something we all have to go through.</p><p>“One thing I know for sure is that the world keeps turning with or without us and time still passes. Dad always used to say to me, ‘Don’t let the b**s grind you down’.</p><p>"He always said to keep on going because better times were coming. I learned to live with my new circumstance and way of life without Dad in it.”</p><p>After leaving Hollyoaks, Gemma moved into glamour modelling.</p><p>She had a boob job in response to weight loss, moving up to a 34E, and became a favourite with the era’s lad mags, posing for sexy shoots with titles including Arena, FHM, Loaded, Maxim, Zoo and Nuts.</p><p>In October 2006 she appeared in three titles at once.</p><p>My life changed with one phone call.</p><span class=quote-credit>Gemma Atkinson</span><p>That prolific run of mag appearances helped propel her to 32nd place in <a href=#>FHM’s 100 Sexiest Women list</a> in 2006 and she rose to 23rd spot a year later.</p><p>Gemma would go on to model for lingerie firm La Senza, as well as fronting Ultimo’s D-G cup range for fuller-busted women.</p><p>She subsequently became a reality TV regular too, appearing on <a href=#>Celebrity MasterChef</a> and finishing fifth on <a href=#>I’m A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here!</a> in 2007.</p><p>That year she also took part in the second and final season of <a href=#>ITV</a> celeb talent contest Soapstar Superstar.</p><p>Gemma then picked up a role in the West End production of Calendar Girls, appearing alongside the likes of EastEnders’ Letitia Dean and telly&nbsp;veteran <a href=#>Lynda Bellingham</a>.</p><p>She returned to a soap in 2015 after joining the cast of <a href=#>Emmerdale</a> as <a href=#>Carly Hope</a>.</p><p>Gemma spent two years on the ITV show — and the high-profile role was partly why she got asked to do Strictly Come Dancing in 2017.</p><p>And she has not looked back since. While people talk about the “Strictly curse”, for Gemma it was quite the opposite. Paired with pro dancer <a href=#>Aljaz Skorjanec</a>, she made it all the way to the final before losing out to actor <a href=#>Joe McFadden</a>.</p><p>But she formed a more lasting connection during the arena tours following the series conclusion, bonding with Spanish dancer <a href=#>Gorka Marquez</a> through their love of the gym and exercise.</p><p>When the string of arena shows came to an end the pair confirmed they were in a relationship.</p><h3>‘I love knowing when I’ll get home each day’</h3><p>They quickly moved in together, becoming fitness influencers in the process.</p><p>Rather than featuring in sexy calendars, Gemma instead published best-selling fitness book <a href=#>The Ultimate Body Plan</a>, aimed at women who want incredible abs like hers.</p><p>After Gemma and Gorka had their daughter Mia, who turns three next month, she spotted the opportunity to publish a second version of her Ultimate Body Plan, this time targeting new mums.</p><p>She explained: “The first book helped so many people. I still get messages and photos from people who did the transformation and felt so amazing, physically and mentally.</p><p>"I thought it would be nice to do a version of The Ultimate Body Plan for women who have had babies and need to find themselves again.”</p><p><a href=#>Gorka proposed to Gemma</a> on <a href=#>Valentine’s Day</a> last year.</p><p>But they were recently forced to postpone the wedding as strict <a href=#>Covid</a> rules remained in place in Spain, where Gorka’s family live. It is not the only bump in the road for the couple.</p><p>Like many in the public eye, Gemma has had to defend their relationship following jibes from cruel trolls who reckoned she is only working out to “keep” handsome Gorka.</p><p>The first book helped so many people. I still get messages and photos from people who did the transformation and felt so amazing, physically and mentally.</p><span class=quote-credit>Gemma Atkinson</span><p>She wrote: “We seem to have gone back a few decades. Note to anyone starting out with a training/health regime.</p><p>"Doing it for anyone but yourself is a set-up for failure. Do it for YOU! You deserve to feel your best. Shut out the noise and crack on.”</p><p>Combining work with family life continues to be a balancing act for Gemma. Gorka is tied up with Strictly commitments from July until <a href=#>Christmas</a> every year.</p><p>Meanwhile, Gemma presents the Drivetime show every weekday on Hits Radio in Manchester.</p><p>She describes the job as a “win-win” because it’s “on her doorstep”, just a short drive from her home in the city.</p><p>She recently returned to <a href=#>Hollyoaks</a> for a brief stint but has ruled out staying on the show in the long term — or heading back to the Dales — as the hours are too demanding these days.</p><p>She has said: “Emmerdale has mentioned me going back.</p><p>“But with soaps, the thing people don’t realise is that the cast and crew do quite gruelling hours.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>“What I love now about my job with the radio is I know every single day when I’m going to get home.</p><p>“I can plan my family life and fit being a mum around that job.” However Gemma spends her time, she is clearly keeping in tip-top condition.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NINTCHDBPICT000394276676.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NINTCHDBPICT000620685460.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NINTCHDBPICT000743385811.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NINTCHDBPICT000364784557.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWhpaWV%2BeIOSa2asrKKesLW42GaqrZmiYrSmucyaZJqsm567tLvNZpuarJViv7C6wKWbqGc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-lauryn-evarts-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Lauryn Evarts Dating Now">&larr;
