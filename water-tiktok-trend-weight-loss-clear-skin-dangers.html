Your skin will thank you."</p><p>But Dr Jon Hewitt, principal dentist at Smmmile in <a href=#>Leeds</a>, said syrups and powders, particularly those containing sugar, corn syrup or citric acid, can have "significant repercussions".</p><p>Not only do they have the potential to erode your enamel and cause sensitivity and pain, they can also stain your gnashers.</p><p>Adding sugars and syrups not only means more calories, it increases the risk of tooth damage and decay.</p><span class=quote-credit>Dr Duane Mellor</span><p>Dr Hewitt said: "Even though adding different flavourings and syrups to water can make it taste better, the trend can have a negative effect on your teeth and overall oral health.</p><p>"I always advise patients to stay away from drinks that include sugary syrups as sugar combines with bacteria in your mouth to create an acid which then attacks your tooth enamel.</p><p>"Some powders and syrups also contain high levels of citric acid that can erode tooth enamel and cause tooth decay, which in turn can cause serious tooth sensitivity and pain.</p><p>"It’s also important to drink flavoured waters in moderation, as a lot of these drinks contain dyes that can cause teeth staining over time.</p><p>"I also suggest washing your mouth after drinking sweetened drinks, to try and get rid of all the sugar left on the tooth surface and reduce the damaging effect it may have on your oral health.</p><p>"This TikTok trend may seem like harmless fun, but consuming these drinks can have significant repercussions."</p><p>Others warned of increased chances of developing more serious health conditions, as well as problems with gut health.</p><p>Consultant dietitian Ro Huntriss said: "Hydration is essential to health, and even survival.</p><p>"But when thinking about keeping ourselves hydrated, it's important to think about the fluids we are consuming and their effect on wider health.&nbsp;</p><p>"The #WaterTok recipes use different flavours and syrups to increase water's palatability - some are sugar-based and others use sweeteners.</p><p>"Consuming added sugar in excess can lead to weight gain, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.</p><p>"The sugar-free versions which use artificial sweeteners reduce the concerns around sugar and calories, however, like most things, they still shouldn't be consumed in excess due to potential negative health implications."</p><h2>'DISRUPTIVE'</h2><p>Speaking to <a href=# aria-label="The Independent (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Independent</a>, Silvia Micheletti, a nutritionist at Rainbow Labs, added: "Artificial flavourings contain high levels of maltodextrins which are highly processed carbohydrates that are derived from starch.</p><p>"They are commonly used as food additives in many processed foods as a thickener, bulking agent, or sweetener.</p><p>"However, maltodextrins are quite similar to sugar and can cause a rapid spike in blood sugar levels, which may lead to health problems for some people such as weight gain, diabetes, fatty liver disease, atherosclerosis, mood swing, fatigue, autoimmune diseases, and cardiovascular disease."</p><p>And Jo Travers, who goes by&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The London Nutritionist</a>&nbsp;online, said: "Water is essential for life and drinking it should defo be encouraged, but unfortunately many of the benefits of drinking it are outweighed by the negatives of adding lots of sugar, syrup, honey and other additives.</p><p>"Sugar in large quantities can spike blood glucose leading to weight gain, and even sweeteners that some processed powders contain can be bad for gut health as they can disrupt the microbiome."</p><p>This can mean bloating, discomfort, and even depression.</p><p>The NHS's Eatwell Guide recommends people should aim to drink six to eight glasses of fluid a day.</p><p>Water, lower-fat milk and sugar-free drinks, including tea and coffee, all count.</p><p>You may need to drink more fluids if you're:</p><ul><li>Pregnant or breastfeeding</li><li>In a hot environment</li><li>Physically active for long periods</li><li>Ill or recovering from illness</li></ul><p>When it comes to sweeteners, the health service says they don't necessarily make food or drink healthy, but they can help reduce your sugar intake, risk of tooth decay and weight gain.</p><p>However, artificially-sweetened beverages are associated with dental erosion due to their acid content.</p><p>They have also been linked to behavioural and cognitive problems, and aspartame in particular may hike your risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer.</p><p>The World Health Organization is reportedly about to designate the ingredient, which gives Diet Coke its sweet touch, <a href=#>"possibly carcinogenic"</a>.</p><p>Experts generally agree that if you want to add flavour to your water, you should try fresh fruits like a slice of lemon, vegetables like cucumber, and herbs and spices like mint or cinnamon.</p><p>Ro, who runs the website&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fertility Dietitian UK</a>, said: "Although #WaterTok can improve hydration levels, when these drinks are consumed in excess there could be negative associations&nbsp;too.</p><p>"Water should be our main drink of choice. A great way to naturally flavour water is with fruits or vegetables such as lemon or cucumber.</p><p>"If you choose to add manufactured sweeteners, it would be advisable to opt for the sugar-free versions, but try to limit your overall intake."</p><p>She added: "It is worth noting that it is possible to consume too much water.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"A good indication of hydration status is looking at the colour of your urine.</p><p>"If it is a pale straw colour, you're doing well, but if your urine is completely transparent, it may be a sign you're drinking more water than you need."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57x56YpayYZIV2g5Ntam1np5bBpr6MraCkrJ%2BgerW%2BxKebZq%2BVnrSpwIylpqyrXZi5pq3RZqqkoZ5isaK6xp6prGc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./aspen-bollok-y5v5-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Aspen Bollok (Reality Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More">&larr;
