However, nothing much is known about his siblings.</p><p>He has also not shared any pictures with any of them on his social media platform. Even though Nickeil hasn’t prominently shared his bond with his siblings on social media, he forged a strong connection with his cousin Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who is also a basketball player.</p><p>Their relationship extended beyond familial ties, marked by a close personal connection and a healthy competitive spirit. In a 2019 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview</a> with the NBA, Shai explained how he and Nickeil shared a lifelong dream of becoming renowned basketball players.</p><p>He added that living that dream now was surreal for both of them. Shai also candidly mentioned that they had almost fought before, coming close to punching each other in the face, emphasizing the intense competition that arises between them.</p><p>Shai continued, “Me and Nickeil are like brothers, and if anybody knows us they know that about us. Having a brother my age who is damn near just as good at basketball we used to go at it all the time.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/brother.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Nickeil Alexander-Walker shares a close bond with his cousin and brother, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. (Source: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Facebook</a>)</p><p>Nickeil also echoed a similar sentiment, expressing profound appreciation for the depth of their relationship that transcended mere familial ties.</p><p>He shared, “I’m fortunate to have him in my life growing up. Having him around, and Shai and his little brother around, made me feel almost as if I was one of them. Since birth, he’s been like a twin brother to me, he couldn’t be any closer. One of my best friends, if not my closest friend.”</p><p>Similarly, Nickeil – whose nationality is Canadian – and Shai have shared numerous pictures of their close bond on various social media platforms. For instance, on September 3, 2019, Shai posted a picture with his cousin-brother in a changing room.</p><p>Along with the picture, he captioned, “Happy bday to my Brother Nickeil Alexander-Walker… u already know what it is no long talk, love you kid,” accompanied by a red heart emoji.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Nickeil Alexander-Walker’s family background</h2><p>Nickeil was born on September 2, 1998, to his parents, Nicholas Walker and Nicole Alexander. While Nicole, his mother, is of Black <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ethnicity</a>, information about his father is not known. Consequently, the basketball player likely shares his mother’s ethnicity.</p><p>Growing up, his mother took on the responsibility of raising him as a single parent while juggling two jobs. In addition to fulfilling traditional parental responsibilities, she introduced him to basketball, instilling not just athletic skills but also valuable life lessons on excelling in every pursuit.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>His mother also steadfastly believed in him throughout his basketball journey, especially during moments when others doubted his potential in the sport.</p><p>The connection between the son and mother grew even stronger over time, evidenced by the numerous pictures the basketball player has shared with his mom on his Instagram.</p><p>For instance, on May 14, 2016, the basketball player posted a heartfelt throwback <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">picture</a> with his mother and a caption expressing deep appreciation.</p><p>In the caption, he stated, “Today is your day, so I want to thank you for always having my back. You were my best friend, my supporter, my mother, and my backbone whenever I needed it.”</p><p>He continued, “You don’t get enough credit and there will never be enough to describe you’re greatness. I love you and will strive every day to give you the world. Happy Mother’s Day,” with a red heart emoji.</p><p>Likewise, on May 8, 2017, he posted a heartfelt picture embracing his mother and expressed profound gratitude, thanking God for blessing him with the best mom. He also acknowledged that without her, life would lack purpose.</p><p>Reflecting on the challenges the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/tag/nba/ rel="noreferrer noopener">NBA</a> player encountered, he credited his mother’s support for keeping him going. The post also highlighted the profound impact his mother had on his playing style and the valuable life lessons she unknowingly imparted.</p><p>The message concluded with a heartfelt wish for a happy Mother’s Day, encapsulating the deep appreciation and love he holds for his mother.</p><p>Moreover, just recently, on November 12, 2023, the basketball player shared a heartfelt <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">selfie</a> of his mom with a simple caption, “Happy birthday to my beautiful and supportive mom. Couldn’t have gotten luckier.”</p><p>The post garnered attention from his followers, with one person commenting, “@nikki_nba always loves how he loves you. Happy Birthday Nik,” reflecting on the visible affection in Nickeil’s expression of love for his mother.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Nickeil Alexander-Walker’s early career</h2><p>Nickeil initially played basketball at Vaughan Secondary School, St. Louis Christian Academy, and Hamilton Heights Christian Academy. At Hamilton Heights, he shared a close bond with his cousin Shai, even rooming together at coach Zach Ferrell’s house.</p><p>Transitioning to college, he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">committed</a> to Virginia Tech in May 2016, choosing them over offers from USC and Maryland. During his freshman year at Virginia Tech, he left a notable impact, averaging 10.7 points and 3.8 rebounds per game.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Impressively, in his second college game, he displayed his scoring prowess by achieving a season-high 29 points in a commanding 132–93 victory over The Citadel. This standout performance early in his collegiate career hinted at the basketball talent that would continue to define his journey.</p><p>Later in his sophomore season, Nickeil continued to shine, maintaining impressive averages of 16.5 points, 4.1 rebounds, and 4.0 assists per game during the regular season.</p><p>His stellar performance played a crucial role in Virginia Tech’s outstanding 24–8 season, where they achieved a notable 12–6 record in the ACC and secured a 4-seed placement in the NCAA Tournament.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6yfnl6YvK570qmmq6yjZLyktMCiZJqfkpa3qnnSmqOaqqlisLC606uYnKxf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./robert-schimmel-dies-following-car-accident.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Robert Schimmel Dies Following Car Accident">&larr;
