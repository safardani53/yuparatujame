He is also the <strong>founder of Embrace The Suck Training Program</strong>, and <strong>host of The Bare Performance podcast</strong>.</p><p>Nick <strong>enrolled in the army</strong> in the year 2013 after completing his undergraduate studies. During his first year of <strong>service at Fort Benning</strong>, he was assigned to the infantry as an infantry officer.</p><p>A short while after, he was sent to Fort Hood in Texas, where he remained for a while. He was the Infantry Platoon Leader in that unit.</p><p>Nick was also <strong>stationed in South Korea</strong> for some time. Whilst serving in South Korea, he was progressively expanding his business and coming up with new ideas to help him take his company even further forward.</p><p>In the year 2017, he decided to leave the United States Army. The military-affiliated bank, USA, was offering loans to ROTC cadets preparing to graduate at the time Nick was in his last year of college.</p><p>Nick took advantage of the opportunity. The loan was for a maximum of $25,000 in value. Nick accepted the chance to make his fantasies a reality by bringing them to life.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Early_Life_of_Nick_Bare></span><strong>Early Life of Nick Bare</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.nextbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Nick-Bare-pic.jpg><p>Nick Bare was <strong>born on August 1, 1990</strong> in Austin, Texas. Nick went to Indiana University of Pennsylvania to pursue his BS (Bachelor of Science) with a major in Nutrition and a minor in business administration.</p><p>While studying there, he was in the ROTC (The Reserve Officer Training Corps) program there. Nick Bare was born to Mike Bare and Linda Bare. He has a brother named Preston Bare.</p><p>In his teens, he suffered from Anorexia and recovered from it in his late teens. After his recovery, he became conscious of his health and started going to the high school football gym to work out with his friends.</p><p>Eventually, he embraced a fitness style and decided to pursue a bachelor’s degree in nutrition.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Nick_Bare_Age></span><strong>Nick Bare Age</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Nick Bare is <strong>33 years old</strong> as of 2023 because he was born on 1 August 1970. Nick is fairly young for his career and he is already very popular on social media and has potential for tremendous success.</p><p>Nick Bare has many tattoos on his body, including a tattoo of his surname on the side of his belly, a tattoo of the words ‘Go One More’ on his wrist, and a tattoo of his surname on the back of his arm.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Where_Does_Nick_Bare_Live></span><strong>Where Does Nick Bare Live?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.nextbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Nick-Bare-.jpg><p>Nick Bare was born in the city of Austin, Texas. Furthermore, he was born under the zodiac sign Leo.</p><p>Nick’s nationality is that of an <strong>American</strong>. He lives <strong>currently in Los Angeles</strong> and is a dog lover. He graduated with honors from the Indiana University of Pennsylvania with a Bachelor’s degree in English.</p><p>He comes from a scientific background. Additionally, he majored in nutrition while concurrently studying Business Administration on the opposite side of the spectrum.</p><p>He was also a member of the Reserve Officer Training.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Nick_Bare_Fitness></span><strong>Nick Bare Fitness</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Being a Nick Bare enthusiast, <strong>Nick Bare loves to work out and exercise</strong>. According to his pictures, you can see his physique is really strong and muscular. If we talk about his diet, he intakes rich protein food.</p><p>He especially consumes a BPN (Bare Performance Nutrition) supplement to make it as fit as a fiddle.</p><p>Before starting his workout he warms up his body with jogging, running, jumps, push-ups, high stepping, lunges, and so on.&nbsp;</p><p>Then he trains his body with pull-ups, swims, deadlifts, dumbbell bench presses, cable rope let pulls, barbell squats, leg extensions, and more.</p><p>After completing four sets of each of these exercises, he takes short breaks accordingly. Therefore he has an intense fitness regime.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Nick_Bare_Natural></span><strong>Is Nick Bare Natural?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>It’s possible to achieve a physique like Nick Bare naturally.</p><p>While it will take a lot of time, patience, and persistence, it’s certainly achievable.</p><p>It’s clear that Nick eats a clean diet and trains consistently, so with the help of natural supplements and some good genetics, there’s no reason why he couldn’t have achieved his physique without steroid use.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_Nick_Bare_Take_Steroids></span><strong>Does Nick Bare Take Steroids?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>There’s no doubt that Nick Bare has achieved some great success by flexing his impressive physique on YouTube. And that kind of success always draws attention from people who immediately say it’s all down to steroids.</p><p>While anabolic steroid use is widespread in the bodybuilding and fitness industry, making such claims without any substantial research is unfair to the guy.</p><p>No matter how gifted your genetics are and how much you train, bulking up whilst maintaining a sub-10 % body fat is nearly impossible.</p><p>The fact that Nick seems to hover around a 12-15% body fat level after a bulk suggests that he doesn’t take steroids.</p><p>He would be much leaner if he did.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_Nick_Bare_Take_Creatine></span><strong>Does Nick Bare Take Creatine?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Nick Bare has <strong>never admitted to taking steroids</strong> and denied steroid use when asked if it helps him maintain muscle after doing ultra-marathons.</p><p>Looking at the totality of evidence, his physique appears natural, so I believe his claims.</p><p>Despite his claims and his natural-appearing physique, Nick has never actually posted any drug test results to prove his claim.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Which_Watch_Does_Nick_Bare_Use></span><strong>Which Watch Does Nick Bare Use?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Nick uses the&nbsp;<strong>Garmin Fenix 6 Pro</strong>&nbsp;for his training, but many of Garmin’s watches are compatible with this feature.</p><p>A game-changing hack to maximize your endurance training can be accessed using the phone and a Garmin smartwatch.</p><p>This little-known feature allows you to program your workouts ahead of time, to provide automatic recall of the day’s training, as well as accountability to rest times and goal paces.</p><p>This is Nick’s approach to Marathon training and one that has drastically enhanced the quality of his big workouts.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Nick_Bare_And_his_Wife></span><strong>Nick Bare And his Wife</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.nextbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Nick-Bare.jpg><p>Nick Bare is married to his wife <strong>Stefany Banda</strong>.
