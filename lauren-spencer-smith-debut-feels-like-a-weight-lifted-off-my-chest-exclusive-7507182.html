In the song, the Vancouver Island native admits she’s ready to settle down and marry her boyfriend. And while she admits she was “scared” to share with the world, the song also made her feel like she was getting her groove back.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I feel like there was a long period of time where I was like, ‘I think I’m a failure and I’m going to be unsuccessful for the rest of my life,'" she admits. "Like, nothing is working. I don’t know what I’m doing anymore.”&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Lauren Spencer Smith.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sam Dameshek</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That period of uncertainty — where clips of her unreleased music weren’t getting 15 million views like a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>TikTok teaser</a> for “That Part” did in early May — was discouraging, and she found herself questioning what her album rollout would look like.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I’m like, 'Am I gonna have any traction before this album comes out?'” she recalls thinking. “I was very stressed.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But Spencer Smith credits much of the success of “That Part” to Jakke Erixson, the same producer who collaborated with her on her first ever hit, “Fingers Crossed."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I think it's cool that it's full circle,” she says of reuniting with Erixson.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though Mirror ends with Spencer Smith happy and in love, it doesn’t start off that way.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“The story starts with realizing you're with someone that maybe doesn't love you like you thought they did,” she says of the album’s opening track, “Never Been in Love."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She continues, “It really sets the tone of the album, like, ‘Wow, I'm not in love. I've never been in love. I want to be in love. This is so sad.’ And then you kind of go through the breakup, the angry [phase] and by the middle of the album, you get to the, ‘Oh, I realized they were a narcissist, I’m kind of healing from this.’”</p><p></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">By the end, though, her life has taken a complete turn. She traces the project's journey as being “scared to fall in love, but by the end of the album, I’m in love and I’m happy.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The final track, “Do It All Again,” is a “representation of everything happens for a reason.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the song, Spencer Smith candidly admits that she would put herself through all of the ups-and-downs she’s endured through the record's 15 tracks again — and the nearly three years since she began writing for it — just to be able to reach the point in life she’s at now.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I’m where I want to be. I would relive every single emotion in this album to be where I am today,” she says, adding, “You leave the album being like, 'wow, that was a rollercoaster,' but everything in life happens for a reason.”&nbsp;</p><p></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She ends the song — and the album — with a full-circle moment as she croons “I’m glad you had your fingers crossed,” in the song’s piano-led outro, referencing the empty promises of love she initially sang about in her debut single.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We’ve never come up with something smarter, lyrically, as songwriters, than what we did in the outro,” she says. “I think people are gonna be shook by that.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Lauren Spencer Smith at the 2023 iHeartRadio Awards.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Christopher Polk/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-75 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As someone whose songwriting career began almost in tandem with their success, Spencer Smith admits she felt for a long time that the songs she wrote were “very simple.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-77 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So she knew that she had to end the album with a bang — and that came both in the form of a creative play-on-words outro and a surprise feature from one of her all-time favorite artists.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-79 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“The person who plays the piano at the end is actually <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>JP Saxe</a>,” she reveals. “It’s really cool that I get to be like, ‘JP Saxe played piano on my album.’”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-81 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She’s hopeful that “Do It All Again” was just the beginning of a partnership with the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>“If the World Was Ending” singer</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-83 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I’m pretty confident we’ll probably write songs together for my second album, and this was just the intro.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-85 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow> PEOPLE's free daily newsletter</a> to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-87 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As she looks back at the three-year journey that led her to Mirror, Spencer Smith is focused on securing a place for herself in the music industry — and moving past any title that keeps her bound solely to TikTok success.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-89 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For now, though, she’s just happy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-91 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I don’t really care if people know me as the TikTok girl or the girl from American Idol.
