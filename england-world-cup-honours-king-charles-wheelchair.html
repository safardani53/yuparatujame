Are you in trouble? What’s this?’</p><p>"It was in the back of my mind all day and when I got home I opened it. I was in complete shock.</p><p>“I had no idea that something like that could happen to me. I’m just a lad from Leeds.</p><p>“This is the cherry on top of the cake. We did all we wanted to do – we won the World Cup and created a new platform for wheelchair rugby league.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN RUGBY LEAGUE</h2></p><p>Pal and team-mate Simpson, who lost both his legs while serving as a soldier in Afghanistan, delivered the news he had known since May 10 to his parents yesterday.</p><p>And the recognition – and emotion – just showed the impact they have made.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Rugby League</h2></p><p>He said, believing his honour is a lot to do with his ambassadorial work for the tournament:&nbsp;“There were only two or three honours given out before in the game’s history, today there are four. That shows the level and stage the game’s now on.</p><p>“I only told my family yesterday and there was a little wobble in my mum and dad’s voice. After everything that happened 14 years ago, getting this MBE is nice.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/WP5_4513-1.jpg><p>“I gave so much in being an ambassador. I worked really hard talking about wheelchair rugby league around the country so the World Cup had the impact it did.”</p><p>And Bechara, who lost a leg in a motorbike accident and who lives in France – where he is a professional trumpeter, added: “Who would have thought when I was lying in hospital after my accident that I would one day get an MBE?</p><p>“I certainly never would have thought it could be possible. Everything that happened last year with the World Cup, and now this – it’s absolutely incredible.”</p><p>Ironically, rugby league is toasting the joy of six after half a dozen from the game received honours.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/WP5_4274.jpg><p>As well as the four wheelchair heroes, Jon Dutton – who ran last year’s tournaments – has been awarded an OBE.</p><p>And Rugby Football League vice-president Sue Taylor is the recipient of an MBE, leading to praise from chairman Simon Johnson.</p><p>He said: “We are delighted by this recognition of the most inclusive World Cup in the sport’s history, and of the thrilling success of our England Wheelchair team.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“Jon and his organising team worked tirelessly to deliver a magnificent tournament, overcoming numerous challenges - most notably the Covid-19 pandemic which led to the 12-month postponement until 2022.</p><p>“Congratulations also to Sue, the ultimate unsung hero, having devoted countless hours to the amateur game in Huddersfield and through the British Amateur Rugby League Association.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH9zg5BxaHBsX5q7qLjAp5tmr5%2BnuaV5wq6nZqCfo7y2vtJmoqKml2Kwqa3RpZysZaedsqa4wqGYoqpf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./rihanna-i-do-not-have-herpes.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="I Do Not Have Herpes!">&larr;
