If a rat gives you a valuable present, know that he thinks highly of you because he doesn't normally open his wallet for others. Rats do not want praise or recognition. They are extremely sensitive and can detect problems. They are generally successful when they take chances.</p><p>People born on June 29 have a zodiac sign of <strong>Cancer</strong>. Cancer, as represented by the crab, smoothly glides between sea and beach, symbolizing cancer's capacity to dwell in both emotional and material realms.
