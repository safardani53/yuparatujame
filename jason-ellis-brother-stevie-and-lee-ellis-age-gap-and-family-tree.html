His younger half-brother Stevie tragically died at 24, which led him to find a way back into tracks away from substance abuse.</strong></p><p>He has another younger brother named Lee Ellis, who pursued a similar career in motorsports. Lee competed in Motocross des Nations, representing Australia.</p><p>Whether it is about family or relationships, Jason, who is openly bisexual, has been in the media talks.</p><p>He made notable highlights after he opened up about being s**ually abused by his now-late father as a child & domestic violence from his then-wife Andrea.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Jason-Ellis-An-Australian-Born-Former-Skateboarder-MMA-Fighter-Auto-Racer-Turned-Radio-Host.jpg><p>Born on October 11, 1971, <b>Jason Shane Ellis&nbsp;</b>is an Australian-born former professional skateboarder, auto racer, and singer.</p><p>To pursue his skateboarding career, he moved to the United States at 17 in 1985 & competed professionally until retirement in 2006.</p><p>He even set the 2001 Guinness World Record for the biggest drop on a skateboard (from a 70-foot skateboard ramp). The record broke in 2006 when Danny Way jumped 82 feet and three inches into a quarter pipe.</p><p>Moreover, Jason had two victorious MMA bouts: vs Tony Gianopulos (in 2009) and vs Gabe Rivas (in 2017).</p><p>Then, he would switch to a broadcasting career & was the host of The Jason Ellis Show on Sirius XM satellite radio from 2005 to 2020. After his show was canceled on the radio, he continued it as a podcast.</p><h2>Jason Ellis Brother: Stevie Ellis (Deceased) And Lee Ellis</h2><p>Jason, the eldest of three brothers, has now only one surviving brother named Lee Ellis after his younger half-brother Stevie died in an accident in 2006.</p><p>As reported, it was after a year of the death of their father due to a heart attack when the tragedy struck the Ellis family again.</p><p>Recalling the heart-breaking incident, he said, “his brother Stevie & his friends were hot-wiring a steamroller in the mountains. The vehicle lost control & knocked over posts on the side of the road before it tipped off the cliff.”</p><p>At the time of death, Stevie Ellis (birth name: Steven Charles Ellis) was only 24 years old.</p><p>Born on March 22, 1982, the late Stevie had an age gap of nearly 10 years with his elder brother Jason Ellis.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Former-Skateboarder-Jason-Ellis-And-His-Late-Brother-Stevie.jpg><p>The demise of his brother made Jason realize the value of his life, his family & loved ones.</p><p>He says, ‘So I just try to do everything because he can’t. It’s like a switch ever since he passed away.”</p><p>As a result, he made his leave from the quicksand of alcohol & drug abuse to become a good father & a family man.</p><p>The former MMA fighter often mentions his late younger half-brother & pays tribute to him.</p><p>On March 22, 2022, Jason <a href=# rel=noopener>wished a posthumous 40th birthday</a> to Stevie & wrote, “My brother Stevie would be 40 today. Happy birthday Deebs, love you forever.”</p><h3>Younger Brother Lee Ellis Competed In Motorsports</h3><p>Jason’s other younger brother Lee Ellis prefers to keep himself away from social media. But the former auto racer cum skateboarder barely misses to mention him on his Instagram & Facebook posts.</p><p>He wished his brother a Happy birthday on Instagram on July 14, 2020.</p><p>He wrote, “Happy birthday to my younger brother Lee Ellis. I won’t bother tagging him because he’s not all about social media like his older brother. But I’m sure someone will show him. I love ya Lee! You’re an awesome father, friend, and husband. I respect the hell out of you! Happy birthday mate.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Jason-Ellis-And-His-Younger-Brother-Lee-Ellis.jpg><p>By profession, Lee Ellis is a motocross racer and represented his homeland Australia in Motocross des Nations through 2004 & 2005.</p><p>Lee enjoys parenthood with his wife, Vic Ellis, though any further information about his relationship is under wraps.</p><h2>Family Tree Of Jason Ellis- Parents & Relationship</h2><p>Jason Ellis is the son of Stephen John Ellis and Lorraine Clark. After his parents separated, his father married Marilyn Ellis (his stepmom) in the mid-1970s.</p><p>The eldest of three sons, Jason grew up with his brother Lee Ellis and paternal half-brother Stevie (who died in 2006).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Childhood-Picture-Of-Jason-And-His-Brothers-Lee-Stevie.jpg><p>Ellis, ‘The Jason Ellis Show’&nbsp;host, lost his father, Stephen, on January 1, 2005, who died of a heart attack at the age of 53.
