She was one of his first girlfriends.</p><p>Despite his young age, Will admitted that he was ready to build a life with Melanie and her family.</p><p>The romance turned turbulent, however, as the rapper discovered Melanie had been unfaithful to him when he came back from a two-week tour.</p><p>Turning to "homeopathic remedies" and "rampant sexual intercourse", Will allegedly even broke one of Melanie's windows with a fire poker.</p><p>The pair reconciled but could never overcome Melanie's infidelity.</p><p>Melanie and Will broke up one last time, overcome with "anger and resentment."</p><p>Deciding to get his revenge, Will collected every item he had bought for her and set them on fire in front of her after a night out.</p><p>Almost nothing is known about Melanie as she does not appear to be in the limelight, unlike Will who rose to stardom in the late 1980s and 1990s.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">ALl the latest on will smith</h2></p><h2>What did Will Smith say about Melanie Parker in his memoir?</h2><p>Will made <a href=#>one revelation after another</a> in his memoir regarding his relationship with Melanie.</p><p>One of them being how he felt the moment their relationship began, recalling being "deeply and totally in love" with her.</p><p>The pair met at Overbrook High School.</p><p>"From the day I met her, Melanie had been the center of my life," he wrote.</p><p>"Healing the pain of her trauma became my constant preoccupation."</p><p>Describing Melanie as "beautiful" with a "beguiling mixture of insecurity and quirkiness surrounding a simmering core of artistic brilliance", Will also wrote that she had gone through a troubling childhood.</p><p>Melanie lived with her aunt in Philadelphia due to her mother being in prison for murdering her father.</p><p>When her aunt kicked her out after a fight, Will feared Melanie would be "sent back to Minneapolis and placed into foster care", so he convinced his parents to take her in.</p><p>Will's parents agreed on the condition that Melanie stayed in the basement and there was "no sex."</p><p>The lovebirds broke the rule less than three months into their relationship.</p><p>Unfortunately for them, they were <a href=#>caught being intimate</a> in the kitchen by Will's mother, who had gone into the room for coffee in the early hours of the morning.</p><p>"And wearing slippers far too quiet to defend her delicate sensibilities, she approached the threshold of the family kitchen", Will remembered.</p><p>"Still innocent, she flipped the light switch as she had done tens of thousands of times before. But this time, her eyes landed upon her eldest son and his girlfriend deep in throes of reckless lovemaking."</p><p>Melanie returned to live with her aunt following the incident.</p><p>"I'm still not exactly sure why I did what I did that night", Will recalled.</p><p>"To this day, I have no idea what I was thinking. Of all the experiences I am sharing in this book, this is the individual moment of personal behavior that makes the least sense to me."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000490102331.jpg><h2>What has Melanie Parker said about her relationship with Will Smith?</h2><p>While Will isn't shy and gladly releases bombshell after bombshell - even <a href=#>about his marriage to Jada Pinkett</a> - Melanie has remained quiet about her relationship with the Men in Black star.</p><p>This may be due to the fact that she keeps a low profile and, therefore, stays away from the spotlight.</p><p>In his memoir, Will recalled their bitter breakup, adding that Melanie had been a victim of "one of the lowest points in [his] life."</p><p>Over the years, he said he has tried to reach out to Melanie on several occasions but none of his attempts were successful.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Will confesses that he has never seen or spoken to Melanie again following their final break-up.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Will Smith admits he drank psychedelic drug ayahuasca more than 12 times for 'spiritual enlightenment' after marriage problems with Jada</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hsYGmDen2YaKSepJGjtqZ5z5qppJ2iYsSquMtmqqahpJ16qLXRpZ2roZWjsXA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-was-the-real-life-mama-coco.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who was the real life Mama Coco?">&larr;
