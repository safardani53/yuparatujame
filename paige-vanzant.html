Her parents owned a music studio, so she was exposed to the music industry at a young age. She enjoyed outdoor activities and was labeled a tomboy as a child. Her favorite pastimes when she was younger were fishing and horseback riding. She was bullied by her classmates in high school. Her classmates’ constant bullying inspired her to become a martial artist. Because of the bullying, she had to change her official name from Sletten to Sutton. As a result, she legally changed her name to Vanzant.</p><h2>Paige VanZant Age, Height, Weight</h2><p><strong>Paige VanZant</strong> <strong>was born on March 26, 1994, and is 29 years old as of 2023.</strong> Her height is 163cm, and she weighs 57 kg.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Paige-VanZant-1.jpg><h2>Career</h2><p>Her parents owned a music studio, so she was introduced to music at a young age. Her parents moved to Nevada, and she came across Shamrock’s Gym while looking for a dance studio. She began gym training and martial arts while at this gym. She won an amateur fight at the age of 18 against stiff competition. Later that year, she defeated Amber Stautzenberger by unanimous decision.</p><p>She was defeated by Torres in a unanimous decision in January 2013 at the Kansas City Memorial Hall. She was one of 11 women who signed up for the Ultimate Fighting Championship the same year. She was scheduled to face Killian Curran in August 2014, but she was unable to compete due to a back injury. However, once she felt better, she faced and defeated Killian.</p><p>She has the most impressive fighting style. She attacks aggressively, grapples, and then strikes. She moves to the fence while standing to use her knees, elbows, and punches. She has written some very interesting books. Her best book is her autobiography, “Surviving The Fight Of My Life.” This book details her life as a celebrity, including the battles and life challenges she has faced.</p><h2>Paige VanZant Achievements And awards</h2><p><strong>Paige VanZant</strong> has competed in 12 matches as a martial artist. She has won eight fights by knockout, submission, or unanimous decision. She is an exceptional writer whose book has inspired many people. She has, however, received no public recognition or nominations. Nonetheless, we are hopeful that her efforts and expertise will be rewarded.</p><h2>Paige VanZant’s Net worth in 2023</h2><p><strong>Paige VanZant</strong> has a significant net worth, which includes her monthly salary and match payouts. <strong>As of November 2023, her net worth is estimated to be $1 million.</strong> Her pay after each match is $20,000, and her monthly salary is around $70,000. Her martial arts career and writing have contributed to her net worth. She is constantly honing her skills, so her net worth may increase over time.</p><p>Paige VanZant’s rise to stardom is fascinating. Despite being raped by her classmates while intoxicated, she used it as motivation to become a martial artist. In addition, through her biography book, she inspires many people to overcome life’s challenges. Paige is rarely involved in controversies, so she has tried to keep her name clean despite being in the spotlight.</p><h2>Paige VanZant Husband, Marriage</h2><p>Paige was raped at a young age by several male classmates after becoming inebriated at a party. This had a negative impact on her self-esteem, and she was on the verge of dropping out of school. Nonetheless, her guardians were extremely supportive, and she had little difficulty overcoming the molestation. She had breast augmentation surgery in 2018 after claiming that they didn’t come out naturally. As a result, she had to buy them. In 2017, she began dating Austin Vanderford, who later proposed to her in January 2018. Austin is an MMA fighter as well as a national wrestling champion. The couple married the same year.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGinmqGXmnq3rc2zmKesXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./teen-mom-maci-bookout-slammed-bentley-diet.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Teen Mom Maci Bookout slammed for insisting son Bentley, 11, cut calories and stick to strict die">&larr;
